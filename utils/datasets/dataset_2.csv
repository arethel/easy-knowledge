psych.pdf,en,262,"Attachment theory While much developmental  psychology concerned itself with  the process of learning, a growing  area of interest arose from the  research carried out by the British  psychoanalyst and psychiatrist  John Bowlby. His study of children  who had been separated from their  families during World War II led   to the formulation of attachment  theory, which deals with the way  we build and maintain relationships  with family and friends, placing   a special importance on the  attachments made by infants to the  people who care for them; Bowlby  saw this as a natural impulse for  survival. The basic ideas of  attachment theory were reinforced  by experiments carried out by  psychologist Harry Harlow in the  US, who showed the effects of  isolation and maternal separation  on infants. His experiments  demonstrated that to build healthy  cognitive and social development,  infants needed companionship   and care. Later research by Mary  Ainsworth built on these ﬁndings,  adding the concept of a “secure  base” from which an infant   can explore the world. Bruno   Bettelheim developed his own, more  controversial, theories of childhood  development from the basis of  attachment theory, rejecting the  importance of the traditional family  after his study of children brought  up communally in kibbutzim. In   the 1960s, social issues such as the  civil rights movement and  feminism were inﬂuencing thought  in both social psychology and  developmental psychology. How   our prejudices are acquired, and   at what stage of development,   became an area of interest for the  African-Americans Kenneth and  Mamie Clark, who based their work  on studies of child development in  Harlem, New York; while Eleanor  Maccoby examined the differences  in development between the   sexes—the ﬁrst of many similar  explorations in the new ﬁeld of  gender studies.

In theory, it describes  a distinct stage between childhood  and adulthood, but in practice often  simply deﬁnes the “teenage” years.  In most Western societies, the idea  of adolescence was not recognized  until the 20th century; childhood  ended and adulthood began at a  certain age—typically at 18. Pioneering psychologist and  educator, G. Stanley Hall, in his  1904 book Adolescence, was the  ﬁrst academic to explore the subject.  Hall was inﬂuenced by Darwin’s  theory of evolution, believing that  all childhoods, especially with  regard to behavior and early  physical development, reﬂect the  course of evolutionary change, and  that we each develop in accordance  with our “ancestral record.” One key inﬂuence on Hall   was the 18th-century Sturm  und Drang (“Storm and Stress”)  movement of German writers   and musicians, which promoted  total freedom of expression. Hall  referred to adolescence as “Sturm  und Drang;” he considered it a stage  of emotional turmoil and rebellion,  with behavior ranging from quiet  moodiness to wild risk-taking.  Adolescence, he stated, “craves  strong feelings and new sensations…  monotony, routine, and detail are  intolerable.” Awareness of self and  the environment greatly increases;  everything is more keenly felt, and  sensation is sought for its own sake.

psych.pdf,en,48,"Modern echoes Many of Hall’s ﬁndings are echoed  in research today. Hall believed that  adolescents are highly susceptible  to depression, and described a  “curve of despondency” that starts  at the age of 11, peaks at 15, then  falls steadily until the age of 23.  Modern research acknowledges   a similar pattern. The causes of  depression that Hall identiﬁed are  startlingly familiar: suspicion of  being disliked and having seemingly  insuperable character faults, and  “the fancy of hopeless love.” He  believed the self-consciousness of  adolescence leads to self-criticism  and censoriousness of self and  others. This view mirrors later  studies, which argue that teenagers’  advanced reasoning skills allow  them to “read between the lines,”  while also magnifying their  sensitivity to situations. Even Hall’s  claim that criminal activity is more  prevalent in the teenage years,  peaking around 18, still holds true. But Hall was not totally negative  about adolescence. As he wrote in  Youth: Its Education, Regiment,   and Hygiene, “Adolescence is a  new birth, for the higher and more  completely human traits are now  born.” So, for Hall, adolescence   was in fact a necessary beginning  of something much better. ■  Born into a farming family   in Ashﬁeld, Massachusetts,  Granville Stanley Hall  graduated from Williams  College, Massachusetts in  1867. His plans to travel were  thwarted through lack of  funds, so he followed his  mother’s wish and studied  theology for a year in New  York, before moving to  Germany. On Hall’s return to  America in 1870, he studied   with William James for four  years at Harvard, gaining the  ﬁrst psychology PhD in the  US. He then returned to  Germany for two years to  work with Wilhelm Wundt   in his Leipzig laboratory.  In 1882, Hall became a  professor at Johns Hopkins  University, Baltimore, where he  set up the ﬁrst US laboratory  speciﬁcally for psychology. He  also launched the American  Journal of Psychology in 1887,  and became the ﬁrst president  of the American Psychological  Association in 1892. ",2075,1112,"The findings of Granville Stanley Hall on adolescence are still relevant today. He observed that adolescents are prone to depression, with a peak at age 15. Modern studies confirm similar patterns and identify common causes of depression in teenagers. Hall also noted that criminal activity peaks during the teenage years, which aligns with contemporary research. Despite the challenges, Hall believed that adolescence represents a new beginning, where higher human traits are born.

psych.pdf,en,183,"One voice at a time One of Broadbent’s most important  experiments was suggested by his  experience with air trafﬁc control.  Ground crew often had to deal with  several streams of incoming  information simultaneously, sent  from planes arriving and departing,  which was relayed to the operators  by radio and received through  headphones. The air trafﬁc  controllers then had to make quick  decisions based on that information,  and Broadbent had noticed that they  could only effectively deal with one  message at a time. What interested  him was the mental process that  must take place in order for them to  select the most important message  from the various sources of incoming  information. He felt that there must  be some kind of mechanism in the  brain that processes the information  and makes that selection. The experiment that Broadbent  devised, now known as the dichotic  listening experiment, was one of  the ﬁrst in the ﬁeld of selective  attention—the process our brains  use to “ﬁlter out” the irrelevant  information from the masses of  data we receive through our senses  all the time. Following the air trafﬁc  control model, he chose to present  aural (sound-based) information  through headphones to the subjects  of his experiment. The system was  set up so that he could relay two  different streams of information at  the same time—one to the left ear  and one to the right—and then test  the subjects on their retention of  that information. As Broadbent had suspected, the  subjects were unable to reproduce  all the information from both  channels of input. His feeling that  we can only listen to one voice at  once had been conﬁrmed, but still  the question remained as to exactly  how the subject had chosen to retain  some of the incoming information  and effectively disregard the rest. Thinking back to his initial  training as an engineer, Broadbent  suggested a mechanical model to  explain what he felt was happening  in the brain. He believed that when  there are multiple sources of input,  they may reach a “bottleneck” if the  brain is unable to continue to process  all the incoming information; at this  point, there must be some kind of  “ﬁlter” that lets through only one  channel of input. The analogy he  uses to explain this is typically  practical: he describes a Y-shaped  tube, into which two ﬂows of ping  pong balls are channeled. At the  junction of the two branches of the  tube, there is a ﬂap that acts to  block one ﬂow of balls or the other;  this allows balls from the unblocked  channel into the stem of the tube. ",2579,1211,"Broadbent's experiment focused on the selective attention process in the brain, specifically how individuals can only effectively process one message at a time.

psych.pdf,en,261,"Piaget raised some fundamental  questions: whether we acquire  knowledge gradually or in distinct  stages; whether certain abilities   are innate or learned; and how the  environment affects development.  His cognitive development theory  suggested that a child’s growth into  adulthood is divided into several  developmental stages, and within  each stage the child learns by doing  rather than instruction. Piaget’s  ideas set the stage for the new ﬁeld  of developmental psychology and  shaped the curricula of schools   up to the present day. Other developmental theories  soon emerged. Although broadly  agreeing with Piaget’s ﬁndings,  Lev Vygotsky argued that it was  necessary for a child to have adult  guidance at various stages in his  learning, and also stressed the  importance of a child’s social   and cultural environment. Erik  Erikson also built on Piaget’s   ideas, identifying eight stages   of psychosocial development,  including the “identity crisis”   of adolescence; while Lawrence  Kohlberg came up with six stages  of moral development in his studies. With the “cognitive revolution”  that followed World War II,  psychologists such as Albert  Bandura looked at the issue of  development again, this time   in the light of cognitive models   of information processing.

Он основал журнал на англий- ском, а также на бенгальском и на широко известном тогдашней интеллигенции персидском языке. По настоянию Рама Мохана Раи и его сторонников правительство запретило варвар- ский обычай сжигания вдов. Он был противником кастового неравенства и проводил свои взгляды на практике в созданном им обществе «Брахмо Самадж». В этом обществе объеди- нились последователи монотеистического религиозного учения, разработанного Рамом Мо- ханом Раи в противовес ортодоксальному индуизму, освящавшему кастовое неравенство. В 1824 г. англичане, расширяя сферу колониальной эксплуа- тации, напали на Бирму. Бирманский народ, несмотря на ока- занное им сопротивление, потерпел поражение. Англичане аннексировали Ассам в долине реки Брахмапутры и соседние с ним районы, а также прибрежные Аракан и Тенассерим. В 1852 г. англичане начали вторую войну с Бирмой и аннексировали область Пегу в дельте ре- ки Иравади. В 40-х годах англичане начали агрессию против Синда и Пенджаба. Прологом к ней яви- лась первая англо-афганская война 1839—1842 гг. Английское правительство, стремясь пре- вратить Афганистан в стратегический плацдарм для борьбы против Ирана и Средней Азии, решило навязать афганскому эмиру Дост-Мухаммеду политический договор. С этой целью в 1837 г. был послан в Кабул Александр Бернс, который, однако, не смог договориться с Дост- Мухаммедом. Последний требовал, чтобы англичане прислали ему денег и оружия, а также заставили правителя Пенджаба Ранджит Сингха вернуть Пешавар, отнятый у афганцев в 1823 г. Не получив согласия, Дост-Мухаммед принял находившегося в Кабуле русского ди- пломатического агента Виткевича, посланного туда Николаем I, для того чтобы добиться за- ключения между Дост-Мухаммедом и Ираном союзного договора, направленного против Ост-Индской компании. Николай I брал на себя роль гаранта выполнения условий договора. Англия решила свергнуть Дост-Мухаммеда и посадить на кабульский престол бывшего правителя Шуджу, изгнанного из Афганистана в 1809 г. и проживавшего в Индии. В 1838 г. англо-индийская армия двинулась в Афганистан и овладела Кабулом; Шуджа стал снова эмиром. Дост-Мухаммед бежал в северные районы Афганистана, надеясь на помощь от цар- ской России. Однако под нажимом Англии Николай I отказался от своих первоначальных планов и дезавуировал Виткевича (Виткевич после этого застрелился). Не получив помощи от Николая I, Дост-Мухаммед сдался англичанам и был увезен в Индию. Вскоре против англичан и Шуджи в Афганистане началась партизанская война. В первых числах ноября 1841 г. в Кабуле произошло восстание, в результате которого англичане, оста- вив всю артиллерию и заложников, спешно покинули афганскую столицу, 15-тысячный от- ряд так и не вернулся в Индию, его уничтожили афганцы. В начале апреля 1842 г. был убит Шуджа. В августе 1842 г. англичане вновь вторглись в Афганистан, захватили на небольшой срок Кабул, разорили его и подвергли население репрессиям. Но вскоре им пришлось очистить страну, так как афганцы продолжали оказывать им яростное сопротивление. Англичане были вынуждены освободить Дост-Мухаммеда. В начале 1843 г. он вернулся в Кабул и восстано- вил свою власть. После поражения в Афганистане колониальные власти в Индии предприняли наступление на независимых эмиров Синда и на государство сикхов в Пенджабе. Этой агрессией англи- чане хотели не только восстановить свой престиж, поколебленный неудачей в Афганистане, но и перенести рубежи своих владений к границам Афганистана.

potter.pdf,ru,81,"       Ухмылка Малфоя заставляла Гарри, Рона и Гермиону очень нервничать всю следующую неделю.  Они проводили большую часть своего времени в темной хижине Хагрида, стараясь урезонить его.        -- Просто выпусти его, -- убеждал Гарри. -- Пусть идет.       -- Я не могу, -- отвечал Хагрид. -- Он слишком мал. Он погибнет.       Они посмотрели на дракона. За неделю он вырос в длину по меньшей мере втрое. Из его ноздрей  вырывался пар. Хагрид забросил свои обязанности егеря, потому что дракон занимал его целиком.  Повсюду валялись пустые бутылки из-под бренди и цыплячий пух.        -- Я решил назвать его Норберт, -- сказал Хагрид, умиленно глядя на дракона. -- Он меня признает,  глядите. Норберт! Норберт! Где мамочка?       -- Совсем с ума съехал, -- прошептал Рон на ухо Гарри.       -- Хагрид, -- громко сказал Гарри. -- Еще пара недель, и Норберт перерастет твой дом. Малфой  может в любой момент пойти к Дамбльдору.       Хагрид закусил губу.        -- Я -- я знаю, что не могу оставить его навсегда, но я не могу выбросить его,  никак не могу.       Гарри вдруг повернулся к Рону.       -- Чарли! -- сказал он.       -- И ты туда же, -- ответил Рон. -- Я Рон, припоминаешь?       -- Да нет, Чарли -- твой брат Чарли. В Румынии. Изучает драконов. Мы можем послать ему  Норберта. Чарли позаботится о нем, а потом выпустит.       -- Классно! -- воскликнул Рон. -- Ты как, Хагрид?       В конце концов Хагрид согласился, что можно послать Чарли сову, чтобы спросить.           Пронеслась еще неделя. В среду вечером Гарри и Гермиона сидели в гостиной, когда все давно  ушли спать. Стенные часы пробили полночь, когда ход за портретом раскрылся. Из ниоткуда возник  Рон, скинувший Плащ-Невидимку. Он был в хижине Хагрида, помогая тому кормить дракона, который  теперь пожирал дохлых крыс бочками.       -- Он укусил меня! -- пожаловался Рон, показывая свою руку, обернутую в окровавленный носовой  платок. -- Я теперь неделю перо держать не смогу. Говорил я, драконы самые жуткие звери, каких я  встречал, но посмотреть, как Хагрид с ним обращается, так подумаешь, что это пушистый домашний  кролик. Когда он меня цапнул, Хагрид сказал, чтоб я его не пугал. А когда я уходил, он пел  колыбельную.       Раздался стук в окно.       -- Это Гедвига! -- воскликнул Гарри, скорей впуская ее. -- Она принесла ответ от Чарли!       Все трое наклонились над письмом.          Дорогой Рон,        Как дела? Спасибо за письмо -- буду рад получить Норвежского Шипохвоста, но доставить его  сюда непросто. Думаю, будет лучше всего послать его с моими друзьями, которые собираются ко  мне на той неделе. Беда в том, их не должны поймать с нелегальным драконом.       Можешь ли ты принести Шипохвоста на самую высокую башню в субботу в полночь? Они  встретятся там с тобой и заберут его, пока темно.       Пришли ответ как можно скорее.       С любовью,                                        Чарли.         Они переглянулись.       -- У нас есть Плащ-Невидимка, -- сказал Гарри. -- Это не должно быть так уж сложно -- в смысле,  Плащ достаточно велик, чтобы спрятать нас двоих и Норберта.        То, что остальные согласились с ним, показывало, как тяжело далась им последняя неделя. Что  угодно, чтобы избавиться от Норберта -- и Малфоя.           Новое препятствие.

С другой стороны, не мне говорить, у меня-то вообще Скабберс.       Крыса по-прежнему дрыхла у Рона на коленях.       -- Он сдохнет, и разницы не заметишь, -- сказал Рон с отвращением. -- Я вчера попытался сделать  его желтым, чтоб он был поинтереснее, но заклинание не сработало. Сейчас покажу, смотри...       Он покопался в своем сундуке и вытащил весьма потрепанную волшебную палочку. Местами на  ней были щербины, и что-то белое проглядывало на конце.       -- Единорожьи волосы торчат. Ладно...       Только он поднял палочку, как дверь купе снова открылась. Мальчик, утративший жабу, вернулся,  на этот раз с девочкой. На ней уже была хогвартская форма.       -- Кто-нибудь видел жабу? А то Невилль потерял, -- сказала девочка, обладавшая командным  голосом, копной каштановых волос и довольно большими передними зубами.      -- Мы ему уже сказали, что не видели, -- ответил Рон, но девочка не слушала, глядя на палочку в  его руке.      -- О, ты колдуешь? Ну-ка, посмотрим.       Она уселась. Рон выглядел неуверенно.      -- Э-э... Ладно.      Он прочистил горло.       ""Солнце, лютики, шалфей,          Глупый жирный крыс, желтей"".       Он взмахнул палочкой, но ничего не произошло. Скабберс остался серым и спящим.       -- Ты уверен, что это настоящее заклинание? -- спросила девочка. -- Не больно-то оно хорошо. Я  пробовала несколько несложных заклинаний, просто для практики, и у меня все получалось. У нас в  семье нет волшебников, это было так неожиданно, когда я получила письмо, но я была так ужасно  рада, конечно, я считаю, что лучшей школы колдовства просто не существует, насколько я слышала, - - Я, разумеется, выучила все наши учебники наизусть, я только надеюсь, что этого будет достаточно --  между прочим, я Гермиона Грейнджер, а вы кто?       Все это было сказано очень быстро.       Гарри глянул на Рона и с облегчением понял по его потрясенному лицу, что тот тоже не выучил  всех учебников наизусть.       -- Я Рон Уизли, -- пробормотал Рон.       -- Гарри Поттер, -- сказал Гарри.       -- Ой, правда, -- изумилась Гермиона. -- Я про тебя все, разумеется, знаю -- я брала несколько  книжек для дополнительного чтения, и про тебя есть в Современной Истории Магии, в Расцвете и  Падении Темных Искусств, и в Главных Магических Событиях Двадцатого Века.       -- Про меня? -- спросил Гарри, слегка обалдев.       -- Господи, неужели ты не знаешь, я бы давным-давно все разузнала, будь я на твоем месте.--  сказала Гермиона. -- Кто-нибудь из вас уже знает, в каком Доме он будет? Я тут поспрашивала, и  надеюсь, что я попаду в Гриффиндор, судя по всему, это самое лучшее, я слышала, что сам  Дамбльдор оттуда, но с другой стороны Равенклоу тоже неплохо... Так или иначе, нам пора идти  искать жабу Невилля. Вы бы лучше переоделись, я полагаю, мы скоро приедем.       И она удалилась, волоча за собой безжабого мальчика.       -- Куда бы я ни попал, надеюсь, что ее там не будет, -- сказал Рон, бросая палочку обратно в  сундук. --  Дурацкое заклинание, мне его Джордж подсунул, держу пари, он знал, что это фальшивка.       -- А в каком Доме твои братья? -- спросил Гарри.       -- В Гриффиндоре, -- ответил Рон. Он опять помрачнел. -- Мама с папой тоже были там. Не знаю,  что они скажут, если я попаду не туда. Вроде бы Равенклоу тоже ничего, но представь, если меня  засунут в Слиферин.       -- Это Дом, где был Вол- , в смысле, Ты-Знаешь-Кто?       -- Да. -- ответил Рон.

psych.pdf,ru,136,"  Рис. 4.14. Решетка Германна. Серые пятна, наблюдаемые на пересечении белых линий,  являются иллюзией. Они видимы вашим глазом и мозгом, но не присутствуют на странице. Чтобы  убедиться в том, что в действительности они отсутствуют, переместите взгляд на другие  пересечения; вы убедитесь в том, что на пересечении, на которое вы смотрите прямо, серого пятна  никогда не видно. Они появляются только в тех пересечениях, которые попадают в ваше  периферическое зрение.    Данная иллюзия является непосредственным результатом взаимосвязей между ганглиозными  клетками, снижающими активность клеток, смежных с наиболее активной. Так, ганглиозная клетка,  фокусирующаяся на одном из пересечений белых линий решетки, получает сигнал, снижающий  уровень сигналов, исходящих от соседних клеток (firing), находящихся со всех четырех сторон (то  есть клеток, расположенных выше, ниже, правее и левее от пересечения). С другой стороны,  ганглиозная клетка, находящаяся на белой горизонтальной или вертикальной линии, будет получать  сигнал, снижающий активность исходящего сигнала только двух соседних клеток, находящихся на  той же линии. В результате пересечения кажутся темнее, чем белые горизонтальные и вертикальные  линии, потому что в этих участках находится максимальное число клеток, получающих сигналы,  снижающих уровень исходящего сигнала.  Но почему темные пятна появляются только на пересечениях, на которые вы непосредственно  не смотрите? Это происходит потому, что дистанции, на которые передается сигнал, значительно  короче в центре зрительного поля, чем на периферии. Благодаря такому расположению ганглиозных  клеток острота нашего зрения значительно выше в центре зрительного поля, чем на периферии.    Восприятие цвета    Свет различается только длиной волны. Зрительная система человека совершает с длиной  волны нечто удивительное: она превращает ее в цвет, причем из разных длин волн получаются  различные цвета. Например, свет с короткой длиной волны (450-500 нанометров) выглядит синим;  свет со средней длиной волны (примерно 500-570 нанометров) выглядит зеленым; а свет с большой  длиной волны (620-700 нанометров) выглядит красным (рис. 4.15).    ",2169,1605,"На рисунке 4.14 изображена Решетка Германа, где серые пятна, видимые на пересечении белых линий, являются иллюзией и отсутствуют на самом деле.

Серые пятна появляются только в периферическом зрении, так как дистанции передачи сигналов короче в центре зрительного поля. Зрительная система также преобразует длину волны света в разные цвета, где короткая длина волны соответствует синему цвету, средняя - зеленому, а большая - красному (рис. 4.15).",588.0
psych.pdf,ru,621,"Физическая привлекательность. Для большинства из нас есть что-то, мягко говоря,  недемократичное в том, что от физического облика человека зависит, насколько хорошо к нему  относятся окружающие. В отличие от характера и склада личности, у нас мало возможности  контролировать физический облик, поэтому кажется нечестным, что этот критерий служит основой  для симпатий. В действительности обследования, охватывающие по протяженности несколько  десятилетий, показали, что люди не очень высоко ставят физическую привлекательность среди  факторов симпатии к другим людям (Buss & Barnes, 1986; Hudson & Hoyt, 1981; Tesser & Brodie, 1971;  Perrin, 1921).  Но исследования реального поведения показывают иное (см. обзор в: Brehm, 1992). Одна  группа психологов устроила «компьютерные танцы», в которых мужчины и женщины из колледжа  были разделены на пары случайным образом. В перерыв каждый заполнял анонимный опросник,  оценивавший ее или его данные. Кроме того, экспериментаторы получили несколько показателей  личностного теста для каждого человека, а также независимую оценку ее или его физической  привлекательности. Результаты показали, что то, насколько человек нравился своему партнеру,  зависело только от его физической привлекательности. Никакие характеристики, вроде интеллекта,  социальных навыков или личностных качеств не были связаны с притягательностью партнеров друг  для друга (Walster et al., 1966). Этот эксперимент был повторен много раз, включая такой же с  мужчинами-гомосексуалистами (Sergios & Cody, 1985), и всякий раз он давал сходные результаты.  Кроме того, физическая привлекательность играет роль не только при первой встрече, но и при  последующих (Mathes, 1975).  Почему физическая привлекательность так важна? Частично причина заключается в том, что  наше социальное положение и самоуважение возрастают, когда нас видят с физически  привлекательным партнером. И мужчины, и женщины оцениваются другими более благоприятно,  когда их сопровождает привлекательный романтический партнер или друг (Shepos, Deming & Young,  1977; Sigall & Landy, 1973). Но тут есть интересный поворот: и мужчины, и женщины оцениваются  менее благоприятно, когда их видят с незнакомым человеком, более привлекательным, чем они сами  (Kernis & Wheeler, 1981). Очевидно, тут они проигрывают из-за сравнения с партнером. Этот эффект  был обнаружен в других исследованиях. Например, мужчины — студенты колледжа, которые только  что посмотрели телепрограмму с участием красивой молодой женщины, оценивали ниже  привлекательность более типичной женщины на фотографии; то же самое было у мужчин и женщин,  которым сначала показали фото очень привлекательной женщины (Kenrick & Gutierres, 1980).  К счастью, у некрасивых есть надежда. Прежде всего, при выборе постоянного партнера роль  его физической привлекательности со временем падает (Stroebe et al., 1971). Как мы увидим далее,  здесь могут сыграть благоприятную роль и некоторые другие факторы.  Близость местонахождения. В 30-х годах в Филадельфии, после изучения 5000 заявлений о  вступлении в брак, обнаружилось, что 1/3 всех пар живут в пределах 5 кварталов друг от друга  (Rubin, 1973). Исследование показывает, что наилучшим из отдельных предсказателей наличия  дружбы между людьми является то, насколько близко они живут. В исследовании схем дружбы в  многоквартирных домах живущих там людей просили назвать имена трех человек, с которыми они  общаются наиболее часто. Жители упомянули 41% соседей, живших в соседней квартире, 22% тех,  кто живет через одну дверь (около 10 м), и только 10% тех, кто живет на другом конце холла  (Festinger, Schachter & Back, 1950). Исследования общежитии колледжа показали то же самое. Спустя  полный академический год среди соседей по комнате друзей оказывается вдвое больше, чем среди  соседей по этажу, а среди соседей по этажу — более чем вдвое больше, чем среди всех жителей  общежития (Priest & Sawyer, 1967).  <Рис. Эти соседи, вероятно, подружатся просто в силу территориальной близости.>  Конечно, есть случаи, когда соседи по коридору и соседи по комнате ненавидят друг друга, и  главным исключением из дружеского влияния близости является изначальный антагонизм. Чтобы  проверить это, испытуемого оставляли ждать в лаборатории вместе с женщиной-коллегой, которая  вела себя с этим испытуемым прилично или плохо. Если она вела себя хорошо, то чем ближе она  сидела, тем больше нравилась испытуемому; если она вела себя плохо, то чем ближе она сидела, тем  меньше нравилась. Близость просто усиливала изначальную реакцию (Schiffenbauer & Schiavo, 1976).  Но поскольку большинство первых встреч попадают в диапазон от нейтральных до приятных,  наиболее частый результат поддержания близости — это дружба.  Те, кто верит в чудеса, когда дело заходит о сердечных материях, полагают, что где-то на свете  существует идеальный партнер, нам предназначенный и только дожидающийся, чтобы его отыскали.  ",4898,2901,"Физическая привлекательность играет роль в том, как к нам относятся другие люди. Исследования показывают, что физическая привлекательность может быть важнее других характеристик при определении симпатий. Но долгосрочные отношения могут быть основаны на других факторах. Близость местонахождения также влияет на возможность развития дружбы, поскольку люди, живущие рядом, часто проводят больше времени вместе и могут развивать близкие отношения.",444.0

Evidence for tumor cells in the subculture implies that they have not been overgrown, may even have a faster growth rate than contaminating normal cells, and may be available for cloning or other selective culture methods (see Sections 9.2.2, 13.6, 24.5). One of the major advantages of subculture is ampliﬁcation. Expanded cultures can be cryopreserved and replicate cultures prepared for characterization and assay of speciﬁc parameters such as genomic alterations, changes in gene expression and metabolic pathway analyses, chemosensitivity, and invasiveness. Disadvantages of subculture include evolution away from the phenotype of the tumor due to the inherent genetic instability of the cells and selective adaptation of the cell line to the culture environment.

bio.pdf,en,131,"8.2.5 Osmolality Most cultured cells have a fairly wide tolerance for osmotic pressure [Waymouth, 1970]. As the osmolality of human plasma is about 290 mOsm/kg, it is reasonable to assume that this level is the optimum for human cells in vitro, although it may be different for other species (e.g., around 310 mOsm/kg for mice [Waymouth, 1970]). In practice, osmolalities between 260 mOsm/kg and 320 mOsm/kg are quite acceptable for most cells but, once selected, should be kept consistent at ±10 mOsm/kg. Slightly hypotonic medium may be better for Petri dish or open-plate culture to compensate for evaporation during incubation. Changes in osmolality are generally achieved by altering the sodium chloride concentration, for example, to compensate for different bicarbonate concentrations (see Tables 8.2, 8.3) or to allow for the addition of HEPES. Osmolality is usually measured by depression of the freezing point (Fig. 8.2), or elevation of the vapor pressure, of the medium. The measurement of osmolality is a useful quality-control step if you are making up the medium yourself, as it helps to guard against errors in weighing, dilution, and the like. It is particularly important to monitor osmolality if alterations are made in the constitution of the medium. The addition of HEPES and drugs dissolved in strong acids and bases and their subsequent neutralization can all markedly affect osmolality.

bio.pdf,en,131,"8.2.6 Temperature The optimal temperature for cell culture is dependent on (1) the body temperature of the animal from which the cells were obtained, (2) any anatomic variation in temperature (e.g., the temperature of the skin and testis may be lower than that of the rest of the body), and (3) the incorporation of a safety factor to allow for minor errors in regulating the incubator. Thus the temperature recommended for most human and warm-blooded animal cell lines is 37◦C, close to body heat, but set a little lower for safety, as overheating is a more serious problem than underheating. Because of the higher body temperature in birds, avian cells should be maintained at 38.5◦C for maximum growth. They will grow satisfactorily, however, if more slowly, at 37◦C. Cultured mammalian cells will tolerate considerable drops in temperature, can survive several days at 4◦C, and can be frozen and cooled to −196◦C (see Protocol 19.1).

Although these properties make such cell lines valuable experimental material, they also make them potentially hazardous for cross-infecting other cell lines [Nelson-Rees & Flandermeyer, 1977; Lavappa, 1978; Nelson-Rees et al., 1981; Masters et al., 1986; Markovic & Markovic, 1998; Kneuchel & Masters, 1999; Dirks et al., 1999; MacLeod et al., 1999; van Bokhoven et al., 2003; Rush et al., 2002; Milanesi et al., 2003; Drexler et al., 2003; Nardone, 2008; Liscovitch & Ravid, 2007; Hughes et al., 2007; Lacroix, 2008; Schweppe et al., 2008] (see also Table 12.2; Appendix V and at www.wiley.com/go/freshney/cellculture).

The line may be characterized, and the characteristics will apply for most of its ﬁnite life span. The derivation of continuous (or ‘‘established,’’ as they were once known) cell lines usually implies a genotypic change, or transformation (see Sections 3.8, 17.2), and the cell formation is usually accompanied by an increased rate of cell proliferation and a higher plating efﬁciency (see Section 17.5). When cells are selected from a culture, by cloning or by some other method, the subline is known as a cell strain. A detailed characterization is then implied. Cell lines or cell strains may be propagated as an adherent monolayer or in suspension. Monolayer culture signiﬁes that the cells are grown attached to the substrate. Anchorage dependence means that attachment to (and usually some degree of spreading onto) the substrate is a prerequisite for cell proliferation. Monolayer culture is the mode of culture common to most normal cells, with the exception of hematopoietic cells. Suspension cultures are derived from cells that can survive and proliferate without attachment (anchorage independent); this ability is restricted to hematopoietic cells, transformed cell lines, and transformed cells from malignant tumors. It can be shown, however, that a small proportion of cells that are capable of proliferation in suspension exists in many normal tissues (see Section 17.5.1). The identity of these cells remains unclear, but a relationship to the stem cell or uncommitted precursor cell compartment has been postulated. Cultured cell lines are more representative of precursor cell compartments in vivo than of fully differentiated cells, as most differentiated cells normally do not divide (see Sections 2.4, 16.3). Because they may be propagated as a uniform cell suspension or monolayer, cell cultures have many advantages, in quantitation, characterization, and replicate sampling, but lack the retention of cell–cell interaction and cell–matrix interaction afforded by organ cultures. For this reason many workers have attempted to reconstitute three- dimensional cellular structures (see Sections 25.3, 25.4). Such developments have required the introduction, or at least redeﬁnition, of certain terms. Histotypic culture, or histoculture (I use histotypic culture), has come to mean the high-density, or ‘‘tissue-like,’’ culture of one cell type, whereas organotypic culture implies the presence of more than one cell type interacting, as the cells might, in the organ of origin. Organotypic culture has provided new prospects for the study of cell interaction among discrete, deﬁned populations of homogeneous and potentially genetically and phenotypically deﬁned cells and an opportunity to create differentiated populations of cells suitable for grafting. In many ways some of the most exciting developments in tissue culture arise from recognizing the necessity of speciﬁc cell interaction in homogeneous or heterogeneous cell populations in culture. This recognition marks the transition from an era of fundamental molecular biology, in which many of the regulatory processes have been worked out at the cellular level, to an era of cell or tissue biology, in which that understanding is applied to integrated populations of cells, to a more precise elaboration of the signals transmitted among cells, and to the creation of fully functional tissues in vitro. ",3860,1396,"Cell culture involves the propagation of cells in a lab setting. There are various techniques for cell culture, including enzymatic or mechanical disaggregation of cells. The process can result in the selection of cells adapted to culture and the possibility of cloning.

Cell lines can be propagated as an adherent monolayer or in suspension, with monolayer culture being common for most normal cells. Suspension cultures are limited to certain cell types.

A similar method has been used in the isolation of human chondroprogenitor cells from cartilage [Archer at al., 2007]. If collagenase in complete medium is used for primary disaggregation of the tissue (see Protocol 11.8), most of the cells that are released will not attach within 48 h unless the collagenase is removed. However, macrophages migrate out of the fragments of tissue and attach during this period and can be removed from other cells by transferring the disaggregate to a fresh ﬂask after 48 to 72 h of treatment with collagenase. This technique works well during disaggregation of biopsy specimens from human tumors.

bio.pdf,en,116,"7.2.2 Feeder Layers Although matrix coating may help attachment, growth, and differentiation, some cultures of more fastidious cells, particularly at low cell densities [Puck & Marcus, 1955], require support from living cells (e.g., mouse embryo ﬁbroblasts; see Protocol 13.3). This action is due partly to supplementation of the medium by either metabolite leakage or the secretion of growth factors from the ﬁbroblasts (actually primitive mesenchymal cells and not ﬁbroblasts), but may also be due to conditioning of the substrate by cell products. Feeder layers grown as a conﬂuent monolayer may make the surface suitable, or even selective, for attachment for other cells (see Sections 13.2.3, 24.5.2; Protocols 22.1, 22.4). The survival and extension of neurites by central and peripheral neurons can be enhanced by culturing the neurons on a monolayer of glial cells, although in this case the effect may be due to a diffusible factor rather than direct cell contact [Seifert & M¨uller, 1984]. After a monolayer culture reaches conﬂuence, subsequent proliferation causes cells to detach from the artiﬁcial substrate and migrate over the surface of the monolayers. The morphology of the cells may change (Fig. 7.1): The cells may become less well spread, more densely staining, and more highly differentiated. Apparently, and not too surprisingly, the interaction of a cell with a cellular underlay is different from the interaction of the cell with a synthetic substrate. The former can cause a change in morphology and reduce the cell’s potential to proliferate. ",1570,988,"Feeder layers are used in cell cultures to support the growth and attachment of fastidious cells, particularly at low cell densities. Feeder layers, such as mouse embryo fibroblasts, secrete growth factors and provide a suitable substrate for attachment of other cells.

The presence of a feeder layer can lead to changes in cell morphology and differentiation, as well as decrease the cell's ability to proliferate.",539.0
bio.pdf,en,116,"7.2.3 Nonadhesive Substrates Sometimes attachment of the cells is undesirable. The selection of virally transformed colonies, which are anchorage independent, can be achieved by plating cells in agar [Macpherson & Montagnier, 1964], as the untransformed cells do not form colonies readily in this matrix. There are two principles involved in such a system: (1) prevention of attachment at the base of the dish, where spreading and anchorage-dependent growth would occur, and (2) immobilization of the cells such that daughter cells remain associated with the colony, even if they are nonadhesive. Agar, agarose, or Methocel (methylcellulose of viscosity 4000 cP) is commonly used (see Section 13.3). The ﬁrst two are gels, and the third is a high-viscosity sol. Because Methocel is a sol, cells will sediment slowly through it. It is therefore used with an underlay of agar (see Protocol 13.5). Dishes that are not of tissue culture grade can be used without an agar underlay, but some attachment and spreading may occur. ",1022,865,"Nonadhesive substrates can be used to prevent cell attachment in certain situations.

The plating efﬁciency should remain constant throughout the range of seeding densities (i.e., a plot of colony number against number of cells seeded should be linear). However, some cells may not plate well at very low densities, and the plating efﬁciency will fall. This can sometimes be minimized by using a feeder layer (see Section 13.2.3). If the plating efﬁciency falls at the higher concentrations, it implies that the cells are aggregating or colonies are coalescing. A seeding concentration that lies within the linear range of the plating efﬁciency curve (Fig. 20.15) should be selected for future assays. The size distribution of the colonies may also be determined (e.g., to assay the growth-promoting ability of a test medium or serum; see Section 10.6.3) by counting the number of cells per colony by eye or estimating it by densitometry. To do so, after ﬁxing and staining the colonies with Crystal Violet, measure absorption on a densitometer [McKeehan et al., 1977] or size the colonies on an automatic colony counter (see Section 20.10.2).

bio.pdf,en,310,"(4) Once a culture has entered crisis, you can then reliably predict the timing of crisis for parallel cultures stored in liquid nitrogen. This prediction allows one to retrieve ampoules from parallel cultures from the freezer and to build up a number of ﬂasks sitting at the threshold of crisis. As these parallel cultures enter crisis and begin to lose viability, these ﬂasks can be pooled. In some cases, there will be an adequate cover of cells in the ﬂask but high levels of cellular debris. In these cases, replate the cells. The cells should be trypsinized and centrifuged, and the pellet should be returned to the original ﬂask. The ﬂask may be rinsed several times with trypsin to remove any adhering cell debris before returning the cells to it. (5) The ﬁrst sign of a culture emerging from crisis is usually the appearance of one or more foci of apparently healthy, robust cells with the typical appearance of SV40- transformed cells. On subculturing, these foci expand to give a healthy, regenerating culture. In many cases the early-emerging postcrisis cells grow poorly, but the growth properties improve with further subculturing, and subcloning helps select individual clones with better growth properties. It is important to freeze an ampoule of your new cell line as early as possible. Our working deﬁnition for an immortal line is that the culture has undergone a minimum of 100 population doublings post-transfection and has survived subsequent subcloning. (6) As the appearance of an immortal derivative within these cultures is a relatively rare event, it is essential that any postcrisis cell lines that emerge are checked to ensure that they were derived from the original starting material and are not the result of cross-contamination from other immortal cell lines in the laboratory (see Sections 12.1.1, 15.2, 18.6; Protocol 15.9).

bio.pdf,en,310,"17.4.4 Telomerase-Induced Immortalization Telomeres play an essential role in chromosome stability and determining cellular life span. Telomerase or terminal transferase is a ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex that synthesizes telomere repeats in tissue progenitor cells and cancer cells. Active human telomerase is composed of three principal subunits, an RNA component (hTR), a protein catalytic subunit (hTERT), and dyskerin (DKC1). Very recently a holoenzyme subunit, TCAB1 (Telomerase Cajal body protein 1), has been identiﬁed, which is notably enriched in Cajal bodies, nuclear sides of RNP processing, and shown to be important for telomerase function as it controls telomerase trafﬁcking and is required for telomere synthesis in human cancer cells [Venteicher et al., 2009]. The RNA subunit is ubiquitously expressed in both normal and malignant tissues, while hTERT is only expressed in cells and tissues such as tumors, germ line cells, and activated lymphocytes. The primary cause of senescence appears to be telomeric shortening, followed by telomeric fusion and the formation of dicentric chromosomes and subsequent apoptosis. Transfecting cells with the telomerase gene htrt extends the life span of the cell line, and a proportion of these cells becomes immortal but not malignantly transformed [Bodnar et al., 1998, Simonsen et al., 2002]. As a high proportion of the htrt+ clones becomes immortal, this appears to be a promising technique for immortalization. Although the functionality of some of these lines has yet to be demonstrated, there are some encouraging reports of uncompromised differentiation, such as in keratinocytes [Dickson et al., 2000] and in myocytes [Wootton et al., 2003]. The preceding introduction and Protocol 17.2 were contributed by Nedime Serakinci, University of Southern Denmark, Institute of Regional Health Services, Telomere Aging Group.

In general, trypsin is more severe than collagenase but is sometimes more effective in creating a single-cell suspension. Collagenase does not dissociate epithelial cells readily, but this characteristic can be an advantage for separating the epithelial cells from stromal cells and maintaining viability in epithelial clusters. Mechanical disaggregation is much quicker than enzymatic procedures but damages more cells. The best approach is to try out the techniques described in Protocols 12.4 through 12.9 and select the method that works best in your system.

If you are working under good laboratory practice (see Section 6.10) conditions, then such records are not just desirable, but obligatory. Records can be kept in a notebook or another hard copy ﬁle of record sheets, but it is best at this stage to initiate a record in a computer database; this record then becomes the ﬁrst step in maintaining the provenance of the cell line.

Records of primary cultures that are unsuccessful are nevertheless data that allow calculation of your success rate.

In microdrop techniques developed later, the cells were seeded as a microdrop under liquid parafﬁn, again maintaining a relatively high cell concentration, keeping one colony separate from another, and facilitating subsequent isolation. As media improved, however, plating efﬁciencies increased, and Puck and Marcus [1955] were able to show that cloning cells by simple dilution (as described in Protocol 13.1) in association with a feeder layer of irradiated mouse embryo ﬁbroblasts (see Protocol 13.3) gave acceptable cloning efﬁciencies, although subsequent isolation required trypsinization from within a collar placed over each colony (see Protocol 13.6). It has also been speculated that clonogenic cells in a population of cultured cells represent the stem cells of that population; hence the number may be quite low in normal adult tissues. If that were so, then recloning from a clone should give a higher plating efﬁciency, but this is generally not the case. It may be that stem cells are in equilibrium with the rest of the population and that equilibrium is reestablished in a cloned strain or simply that clonogenic cells are not synonymous with stem cells.

bio.pdf,en,41,"2.3.1 Cell Cycle The cell cycle is made up of four phases (Fig. 2.4). In the M phase (M = mitosis) the chromatin condenses into chromosomes, and the two individual chromatids, which make up the chromosome, segregate to each daughter cell. In the G1 (Gap 1) phase, the cell either progresses toward DNA synthesis and another division cycle or exits the cell cycle reversibly (G0) or irreversibly to commit to differentiation. It is during G1 that the cell is particularly susceptible to control of cell cycle progression at a number of restriction points, which determine whether the cell will re-enter the cycle, withdraw from it, or withdraw and differentiate. G1 is followed by the S phase (DNA synthesis), in which the DNA replicates. S in turn is followed by the G2 (Gap 2) phase in which the cell prepares for re-entry into mitosis. Checkpoints at the beginning of DNA synthesis and in G2 determine the integrity of the DNA and will halt the cell cycle to allow DNA repair or entry into apoptosis if repair is impossible. Apoptosis, or programmed cell death [Al- Rubeai & Singh, 1998], is a regulated physiological process whereby a cell can be removed from a population. Marked by DNA fragmentation, nuclear blebbing, and cell shrinkage (see Plate 17c, d), apoptosis can also be detected by a number of marker enzymes with kits such as Apotag (Oncor) or the COMET assay [Maskell & Green, 1995].

bio.pdf,en,41,"2.3.2 Control of Cell Proliferation Entry into the cell cycle is regulated by signals from the environment. Low cell density leaves cells with free edges and renders them capable of spreading, which permits their entry into the cycle in the presence of mitogenic growth factors, such as epidermal growth factor (EGF), ﬁbroblast growth factors (FGFs), or platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) (see Sections 8.5.2, 9.4.5; Table 9.4), interacting with cell surface receptors. High cell density inhibits the proliferation of normal cells (though not transformed cells) (see Section 17.5.2). Inhibition of proliferation is initiated by cell contact and is accentuated by crowding, and the resultant change in the shape of the cell and reduced spreading with fewer focal adhesions. Intracellular control is mediated by positive-acting factors such as the cyclins [McDonald & El-Deiry, 2000; Reed, 2003; Santamaria & Ortega, 2006] (see Fig. 2.4), which are upregulated by signal transduction cascades activated by phosphorylation of the intracellular domain of the receptor when it is bound to growth factor. Negative-acting factors such as p53 [Schwartz & Rotter, 1998], p16 and p21 [Caldon Fig. 2.4. Cell Cycle. The cell cycle is divided into four phases: G1, S, G2, and M. Progression round the cycle is driven by cyclins activated by cell division cycle kinases (Cdks), which in turn have been activated by regulatory genes, such as myc. Expression of positive-acting regulatory genes, such as myc, is induced by cytoplasmic signals initiated by receptor kinase following interaction with a mitogen, and transmitted via a signal transduction pathway, such as MAP kinase (a). The cell cycle is arrested at restriction points in G1 by the action of Rb, and other cell cycle inhibitors in the absence of mitogens (b). When these are inactivated, usually by phosphorylation (Rb∗), cells proceed round the cycle (a). The cell cycle can also be arrested at check points by cell cycle inhibitors such as and p53 if DNA damage is detected (c). Phosphorylation of p53 (p53∗) allows the cycle to proceed (a).

bio.pdf,en,130,"8.2.4 Oxygen The other major constituent of the gas phase is oxygen. Whereas most cells require oxygen for respiration in vivo, cultured cells often rely mainly on glycolysis, a high proportion of which, as in transformed cells, may be anaerobic. Oxygen is still required, however. The use of O2 carriers, such as perﬂuorocarbon [Radisic et al., 2006] or hemoglobin [Chen and Palmer, 2008], has had some success but is not widespread, and most cultures rely chieﬂy on dissolved O2, which can be toxic due to the elevation in the level of free radicals. Providing the correct O2 tension is therefore always a compromise between fulﬁlling the respiratory requirement and avoiding toxicity. Strategies involving both elevated and reduced O2 levels have been employed, as has the incorporation of free radical scavengers, such as glutathione, 2-mercaptoethanol (β-mercaptoethanol), or dithiothreitol, into the medium. Most such strategies have been derived empirically. Some incubators allow control of oxygen as well as CO2 (e.g., New Brunswick Innova). Cultures vary in their oxygen requirement, the major distinction lying between organ and cell cultures. Although atmospheric or lower oxygen tensions [Cooper et al., 1958; Balin et al., 1976] are preferable for most cell cultures, some organ cultures, particularly from late-stage embryos, newborns, or adults, require up to 95% O2 in the gas phase [Trowell, 1959; De Ridder & Mareel, 1978]. This requirement for a high level of O2 may be a problem of diffusion related to the geometry and gaseous penetration of organ cultures (see Section 25.2.1) but may also reﬂect the difference between differentiated and rapidly proliferating cells. Oxygen diffusion may also become limiting in porous microcarriers [Preissmann et al., 1997] (see also Section 26.2.4). Most dispersed cell cultures prefer lower oxygen tensions, and some systems (e.g., human tumor cells in clonogenic assay [Courtenay et al., 1978], human embryonic lung ﬁbroblasts [Balin et al., 1976], and mesenchymal stem cells [Ma et al., 2009]) prefer hypoxic conditions. McKeehan et al. [1976] suggested that the requirement for selenium in medium is related to oxygen toxicity, as selenium is a cofactor in glutathione synthesis. Oxygen tolerance—and selenium as well—may be provided by serum, so the control of O2 tension is likely to be more critical in serum-free media.

This category includes hydro- cortisone, glucagon, and thyroxin (or triiodothyronine). (2) Vitamins such as vitamin D3 [Jeng et al., 1994; Rattner et al., 1997] and retinoic acid [Saunders et al., 1993; Hafny et al., 1996; Ghigo et al., 1998] are derived from the diet and may be modiﬁed by metabolism. (3) Inorganic ions, particu- larly Ca2+—high Ca2+ promotes keratinocyte differentiation [Cho & Bikle, 1997] (see Section 22.2.1 for an example). This probably relates to the role of calcium in cell interaction (cad- herins are calcium-dependent), intracellular signaling, and the membrane ﬂux of calcium in so-called calcium waves that propagate signals from one responding cell to adjacent cells of the same lineage (see Fig. 2.8). Along with gap junctional communication, and possibly homocrine factors and heparan sulfate, this helps generate a coordinated response. Other physiological inducers, the paracrine factors (see Section 16.7.1), are assumed to act directly, cell to cell, without the need for vascular transmission.

The pax deorum, or peace with the gods, struck  a clear bargain: as long as you and your state worshipped the gods and maintained peace with  them, they would make it prosper. And prosper it did! Starting out as a tiny village on the marshes  of the Tiber, the Roman Empire at its height encircled the entire Mediterranean, extending to  Britain and the Rhine and Danube frontiers to the north, and including a wide strip of North  Africa in its southern half. But something went so terribly wrong along the way, testing the gods’  patience with Rome. A new sect started out in Judaea in the first century CE, one which followed  a crucified Messiah. Spreading outward like a wildfire to all parts of the empire, this sect chal- lenged and gradually replaced the worship of the traditional gods, bringing even the emperors  into its fold, starting with Constantine in the early fourth century CE. This outright violation of  the thousand-year old pact between the Romans and their gods could have only one outcome:  the ultimate punishment would come from the gods  upon this rebellious state.

hist.pdf,en,20,"Historian Lauren Ristvet defines agriculture as the “‘domestication’ of plants… causing it to  change genetically from its wild ancestor in ways [that make] it more useful to human consum- ers.”12 She and hundreds of other scholars from Hobbes to Marx have pointed to the Neolithic  Revolution, that is, the move from a hunter-gatherer world to an agricultural one, as the root of  what we today refer to as civilization. Without agriculture we don’t have empires, written language,  factories, universities, or railroads. Despite its importance, much remains unclear about why and  where agriculture began. Instead, scholars hold a handful of well-regarded theories about the  roots (pun intended) of agriculture.  Most scholars agree that the Ice Age played a fundamental role in the rise of agriculture,  in the sense that it was impossible during the much colder and often tundra-covered period of  the Pleistocene, but inevitable during the Holocene thawing. Only 4,000 years before the origins  of agriculture, the planting of anything would have been an exercise in futility. During the Last  Glacial Maximum (24,000 – 16,000 years ago), average temperatures dropped “by as much as  57˚ F near the great ice sheets…”13 of Spain or the North American Great Plains were increasingly covered in ice, but also that other  areas around the world could not depend on constant temperatures or rainfall from year to year.  Pleistocene foragers had to be flexible. The warming trend of the Holocene, by contrast, resulted  in consistent rainfall amounts and more predictable temperatures. The warming also altered the  habitats of the megafauna that humans hunted, alterations that in some cases contributed to their  extinction. Therefore, as animal populations declined, humans were further encouraged to plant  and cultivate seeds in newly-thawed soil.  ",1855,1013,"Historians and scholars like Lauren Ristvet consider agriculture the domestication of plants, leading to genetic changes for human consumption. The Neolithic Revolution, the shift from hunter-gatherer societies to agriculture, is seen as the foundation of civilization. Despite its significance, questions remain about the origins of agriculture. It is believed that the Ice Age played a role, making agriculture impossible, while the Holocene thawing created conditions favorable for farming.

hist.pdf,en,20,"When we start to examine other factors that allowed humans to transition to agriculture, we  find that the climate factor looms even larger. For example, agriculture was usually accompa- nied by sedentarism, but we see communal living and permanent settlements among multiple  groups of hunter-gatherers. Homo sapiens had also begun to domesticate animals and plants  alike during the Pleistocene. Humans were already being buried alongside dogs as early as 14,000  years ago.14 As we’ll see below, gatherers were developing an increasing taste for grains long  before they would abandon a foraging lifestyle. Essentially, humans were ready for agriculture  when climate permitted it.  We discuss elsewhere the timing of agriculture’s appearance in all of the continents, but  generally speaking by about 8,000 years ago, farmers in West Asia were growing rye, barley, and  wheat. In northern China, millet was common 8,500 years ago. In the Americas, the domestication  of maize began around 8,000 years ago in Mesoamerica, while at about the same time, Andean  residents began cultivating potatoes.

Similarly, when children enter a school system built on the foundation of  Stage 1 thinking (as most school systems are), they are likely to be told, “We have  the questions and the answers; your role is to learn them, not ask questions of your  own”—an approach that runs counter to children’s natural curiosity. People in this Garden of Eden stage of thinking become dissatisfied when they  realize that they can’t simply rely on authorities to tell them what to think and believe  because in almost every arena—medicine, religion, economics, psychology, educa- tion, science, law, child-rearing—authorities often disagree with each other.

As Aristotle observes: “If purpose is present in art, it must also be  present in nature.” In summary, there are multiple types of causal relations in the world. But since our  attempt to assign causes or grasp the “why” of a thing in question is inseparably con- nected with offering an explanation, the notion of a cause is inextricably tied to that  of explanation. From Aristotle’s perspective—and those philosophers who embrace  his hylomorphic framework—these four causes are just different modes of explana- tion. So we can analyze and cite the cause or explain a thing, say Clara’s activity of  erecting a new building across the street by appealing to the material of which it is  constructed (material cause); the structure, organization, or form of the building, and  taken robustly its essence or nature ( formal cause); the agent that brought it about  actually, the builder, but potentially the owner of the building if the latter is not identi- cal with the former (efficient cause); and finally the function or purpose for which the  project was executed, for instance convening international conferences or providing  shelter for the homeless ( final cause).  Aristotle extends this concept of Final Cause to the universe as a whole, a cosmo- logical concept that he variously characterizes as “first (Final) cause,” “prime mover,”  and “pure thought, thinking thought.” This is not a “God” as a Creator but rather  an impersonal teleological principle that permeates the universe as a whole. Aristo- tle arrives at this conclusion through an intriguing—and famous—argument. If we  examine each of the Four Causes, we can see that each one assumes the existence of  something that came before. But to avoid what philosophers term an infinite regress,  we need to posit a First Final Cause. ",2418,1139,,
phil.pdf,en,277,"Moreover, it is obvious that there is some first principle, and that the causes of things  are not infinitely many either in a direct sequence or in kind. For the material generation  of one thing from another cannot go on in an infinite progression (e.g. flesh from earth,  earth from air, air from fire, and so on without a stop); nor can the source of motion  (e.g. man be moved by air, air by the sun, the sun by Strife, with no limit to the series). In  the same way neither can the Final Cause (that is, purposes) recede to infinity—walking  having health for its object, and health happiness, and happiness something else: one  thing always being done for the sake of another. And it is just the same with the Formal  Cause (that is, the essence). For in the case of all intermediate terms of a series which are  contained between a first and last term, the prior term is necessarily the cause of those  which follow it; because if we had to say which of the three is the cause, we should say  “the first.” At any rate it is not the last term, because what comes at the end is not the  cause of anything. Neither, again, is the intermediate term, which is only the cause of  one (and it makes no difference whether there is one intermediate term or several, nor  whether they are infinite or limited in number). But of series which are infinite in this way,  and in general of the infinite, all the parts are equally intermediate, down to the present  moment. Thus if there is no first term, there is no cause at all. ",1525,971,,
phil.pdf,en,330,"All the objects of human reason or enquiry may naturally be divided into two kinds, to  wit, Relations of Ideas, and Matters of Fact. Of the first kind are the sciences of Geom- etry, Algebra, and Arithmetic; and in short, every affirmation which is either intuitively  or demonstratively certain. That the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the square of  the two sides, is a proposition which expresses a relation between these figures. That  three times five is equal to the half of thirty, expresses a relation between these numbers.  Propositions of this kind are discoverable by the mere operation of thought, without  dependence on what is anywhere existent in the universe. Though there never were a  circle or triangle in nature, the truths demonstrated by Euclid would for ever retain their  certainty and evidence. Matters of fact, which are the second objects of human reason, are not ascertained  in the same manner; nor is our evidence of their truth, however great, of a like nature  with the foregoing. The contrary of every matter of fact is still possible; because it can  never imply a contradiction, and is conceived by the mind with the same facility and  distinctness, as if ever so conformable to reality. That the sun will not rise to-morrow is  no less intelligible a proposition, and implies no more contradiction than the affirmation,  that it will rise. We should in vain, therefore, attempt to demonstrate its falsehood. Were  it demonstratively false, it would imply a contradiction, and could never be distinctly  conceived by the mind. ",1570,952,,
phil.pdf,en,103,"Socrates wastes no time in demolishing the remaining accusations Meletus has  brought against him at the behest of Anytus. He begins by demanding a clear defini- tion of the key concepts under discussion—in this case, the accusation that Socrates  is corrupting the young “by teaching them not to believe in the gods the state believes  in, but other new divinities instead.” In fact, the insistence on “defining your terms”  has been a core strategy of philosophy ever since Socrates introduced it. Why is it so  important to begin discussions with a clear and precise definition of key terms and  concepts? It’s because those definitions form the bedrock of analysis. If the concepts  are permitted to remain vague and ambiguous, it’s impossible to make meaningful  progress in the analysis and exploration of those terms. That’s exactly why so many  discussions and debates go awry, because vague, imprecise definitions encourage  each party to “fill in” their own meanings, encouraging miscommunication and con- ceptual confusion. So Socrates presses Meletus: But in truth, Athenians, I do not think that I need say very much to prove that I have not  committed the crime for which Meletus is prosecuting me. What I have said is enough to  prove that. But I repeat it is certainly true, as I have already told you, that I have aroused  much indignation. That is what will cause my condemnation if I am condemned; not  Meletus nor Anytus either, but that prejudice and suspicion of the multitude which have  been the destruction of many good men before me, and I think will be so again.

In the same  way that Thrasymachus ends up contradicting himself as he struggles to define and  redefine “might makes right,” so Meletus now finds himself in the position of main- taining that Socrates is a wrongdoer who does not believe in gods, but who believes  in the gods. Reductio ad absurdum! Despite administering the coup de grâce to Meletus’s feeble argument, Socrates  goes on to pursue an intriguing line of reasoning that will foreshadow one of the  strongest arguments for the existence of God—the argument by design—used consis- tently during the past several thousand years.

For example, in the early part of the  twentieth century, the dramatic case of Rich- ard Loeb and Nathan Leopold transfixed the  United States. These two young men, who were  from privileged families and who had attended  the best schools, abducted and murdered a fourteen-year-old boy just to experience  the thrill of killing someone. The country was outraged at such a cold-blooded and  senseless killing, and public opinion favored giving them the death penalty. Hired  to defend them, and save their lives, was the famed attorney, Clarence Darrow. In  his famous summation, he passionately employed the hard determinist argument to  convince the judge that the defendants were victims of circumstances beyond their  control, not autonomous agents making free choices: We are all helpless. . . .

phil.pdf,en,342,"For Kant to effectively commit Hume’s critique “to the flames” (Hume’s volatile  image) and build a compelling theory of knowledge from the ashes, Kant needs to  address both “forks” of Hume’s attack on the possibility of knowledge. And this is pre- cisely what Kant does through his theory of transcendental idealism—an epistemology  that describes truths about the world that are both necessary and universal. For all his intellectual power, Kant grounds his  theory firmly in the world of lived experience. It is an  incontrovertible fact that the world of objects exists,  that objects are related in lawlike ways that science and  common sense can discover (including cause and effect  and induction), and that we can develop knowledge  about the world that is compelling and verifiable. Yet  rationalism and empiricism both run into dead ends,  being forced to conclude that all these incontrovertible  facts of experience are uncertain and ungrounded. For  Kant, this conflict between the evidence of real-world  experience and the epistemological skepticism of vari- ous theories could mean only one thing: The theories  are profoundly flawed. So Kant turned the prevailing  trend in epistemology upside down. Instead of ques- tioning whether science could legitimately claim to  discover knowledge, Kant initiates his inquiry with the  following challenge: Science already has discovered  knowledge that is necessary, universal, and certain: How  is this possible? What is the nature of the way the human mind  works that makes the discovery of such knowledge a reality? Thus begins Kant’s “Copernican revolution” in  epistemology.

phil.pdf,en,505,"For Aristotle and other believers in virtue ethics, it is the cultivation of a virtuous  character that is the goal of ethics, to become a virtuous person. The assumption is that  genuinely virtuous people will act in morally principled ways as a natural expression  of their moral goodness. And these moral actions will in turn strengthen their virtu- ous nature. Aristotle’s particular brand of virtue ethics has had a dominating impact  on moral thinking for several thousand years. Aristotle’s major work in this area is The  Nicomachean Ethics, named after his son Nicomachus. Let’s explore his central ethical  themes as expressed in this enduring treatise, beginning with his views on the nature  of moral character and the ultimate goal for which all humans strive.

Similarly it is by doing just acts that we become just, by doing temperate acts that  we become temperate, by doing courageous acts that we become courageous. . . . It  is by acting in such transactions as take place between man and man that we become  either just or unjust. It is by acting in the face of danger and by habituating ourselves to  fear or courage that we become either cowardly or courageous. ",681,774,,

Your moral character refers to the integrated total- ity of your moral traits and dispositions, the ways in which you habitually respond  when confronted with moral choices. Your character typically displays consistency  and coherence because it has been created gradually, inscribed over the totality of  your life.

phil.pdf,en,217,"What a stirring rallying cry for indeterminists, who often seem on the defensive  against the mechanistic onslaughts of deterministic arguments: “Our first act of free- dom, if we are free, ought . . . to be to affirm that we are free. . . .” But James’s affir- mation is more than a rallying cry: He is making an epistemological statement about  the free-will controversy. His philosophical point is that, if free will genuinely exists,  then the exercise of it is the strongest evidence for its existence. He has no tolerance  for those who are not prepared to commit themselves one way or the other regard- ing free will, for “not committing” is itself a free choice—just not a very authentic  or courageous choice, in James’s eyes. If you live your life as though free will exists,  then you should come forward and affirm in a loud and clear voice, “I believe that  I am able to make free choices.” This primal affirmation is itself the ground for  believing that your statement is true. The testimony of your direct, lived experience  confirms its validity. This resounding affirmation of free will is the cornerstone of James’s overall posi- tion, and he next proceeds to lay the foundation of his general argument. ",1223,887,,

The arguments I am about to urge all proceed on two sup- positions: first, when we make theories about the world and discuss them with one  another, we do so in order to attain a conception of things which shall give us subjective  satisfaction; and second, if there be two conceptions, and the one seems to us, on the  whole, more rational than the other, we are entitled to suppose that the more rational  one is the truer of the two. . . . ",552,746,,
phil.pdf,en,217,"James is setting out his basic epistemological criteria for determining truth and  knowledge, and his view is remarkably similar to that of phenomenologists such as  Edmund Husserl and Maurice Merleau-Ponty, whom we examined in Chapter 3.   From this perspective, humans use their intellectual abilities to create concepts and  create theories to help them understand and give meaning to their lived experi- ence. When theories conflict with one another, how do we decide which theories  are the “best”? In the final analysis, we should endorse those theories that provide  the most rational, clearest, complete, and persuasive understanding of our lived  experience. By setting out his basic criteria of evaluation, James is making clear the direction  his argument is going to take with respect to free will. Deterministic theories such  as those advanced by Baron d’Holbach are, in the final analysis, inferior to inde- terminist theories because they do an inferior job of helping us understand our  lived experience. In fact, as we have seen, and as the determinists openly acknowl- edge, their theories consistently contradict and clash with our lived experience.  Why should we give epistemological precedence to these determinist theories over  testimony of our lived experience, which tends to support an indeterminist point of  view? We shouldn’t, James believes. And when people do commit themselves to theo- ries that provide an inadequate account of our experience, they have completely  lost sight of the essential purpose of concepts and theories—to help us clarify our  experience, not distort it. James continues to build his case by reviewing the traditional arguments for and  against free will. ",1715,963,,
phil.pdf,en,403,"The logic of this argument is straightforward: When we examine the universe, we  observe that, as Heraclitus noted, “All is change,” as everything is continually mov- ing, evolving, changing. Each state of change is the result of a prior state, which is  the result of a prior state, and so on. It is rational for us to assume (the proof argues)  that at some point, there is an ultimate, unchanging source of all change; and that  source is God. The second argument mirrors the first, substituting the concept of “causation” for  “motion.” The existence of God can be shown in five ways. The first and more manifest way is the argument from motion. It is certain, and  evident to our senses, that in the world some things are in motion. Now whatever is in  motion is put in motion by another, for nothing can be in motion except it is in poten- tiality to that towards which it is in motion; whereas a thing moves inasmuch as it is in  actuality. For motion is nothing else than the reduction of something from potentiality  to actuality. But nothing can be reduced from potentiality to actuality, except by some- thing in a state of actuality. Thus that which is actually hot, as fire, makes wood, which  is potentially hot, to be actually hot, and thereby moves and changes it. Now it is not  possible that the same thing should be at once in actuality and potentiality in the same  respect, but only in different respects. For what is actually hot cannot simultaneously  be potentially hot; but it is simultaneously potentially cold. It is therefore impossible that  in the same respect and in the same way a thing should be both mover and moved, i.e.  that it should move itself. Therefore, whatever is in motion must be put in motion by  another. If that by which it is put in motion be itself put in motion, then this also must  needs be put in motion by another, and that by another again. But this cannot go on to  infinity, because then there would be no first mover, and, consequently, no other mover;  seeing that subsequent movers move only inasmuch as they are put in motion by the  first mover; as the staff moves only because it is put in motion by the hand. Therefore  it is necessary to arrive at a first mover, put in motion by no other; and this everyone  understands to be God. ",2299,1144,,
phil.pdf,en,403,"Both of these arguments rest on Aquinas’s assumption that there must be an un- changing source of change or a “first cause” of all causal events because the alter- native would be an “infinite regress,” which is metaphysically and epistemologically  unacceptable. Our understanding demands that there be a beginning point, whether  it’s an unchanging source of change or a “first cause” of all causal events. But is this  The second way is from the nature of the efficient cause. In the world of sense we find  there is an order of efficient causes. There is no case known (neither is it, indeed, pos- sible) in which a thing is found to be the efficient cause of itself; for so it would be prior  to itself, which is impossible. Now in efficient causes it is not possible to go on to infinity,  because in all efficient causes following in order, the first is the cause of the intermediate  cause, and the intermediate is the cause of the ultimate cause, whether the intermediate  cause be several, or only one. Now to take away the cause is to take away the effect.  Therefore, if there be no first cause among efficient causes, there will be no ultimate, nor  any intermediate cause. But if in efficient causes it is possible to go on to infinity, there  will be no first efficient cause, neither will there be an ultimate effect, nor any intermedi- ate efficient causes; all of which is plainly false. Therefore it is necessary to admit a first  efficient cause, to which everyone gives the name of God. ",1508,950,,
phil.pdf,en,154,"As an abstract organizing principle, it appears to be difficult to distinguish one  transcendental self from another. As a result, Kant identifies another self the empirical  self (or ego), which includes all of those particular aspects of our selves that make us  uniquely different people: bodies, memories, personalities, ways of thinking, emo- tional patterns, and so on. The obvious problem is that this model of consciousness  leaves us with two selves, leading to some disquieting questions: How do these two  selves relate to one another? Is one self more primary or fundamental than the other?  Which self is our “true” self, our identity, our soul? Are we condemned to be meta- physical schizophrenics? Kant tries mightily to answer these troubling and enigmatic  questions, but it’s a very difficult challenge. Sigmund Freud’s view of the self leads to an analogous dualistic view of the self,  though the contours and content of his ideas are very different from Kant’s. Freud is  not, strictly speaking, a philosopher, but his views on the nature of the self have had a  far-reaching impact on philosophical thinking, as well as virtually every other discipline  in the humanities and social sciences. Naturally, his most dominant influence has been  in the fields of psychology and psychoanalysis. Freud’s view of the self was multitiered,  divided among the conscious, preconscious, and unconscious. He explains his psycho- logical model in the following passage from his An Outline of Psychoanalysis. ",1517,934,,
phil.pdf,en,154,"There is no need to characterize what we call conscious: it is the same as the conscious- ness of philosophers and of everyday opinion. Everything else that is mental is in our  view unconscious. We are soon led to make an important division in this unconscious.  Some processes become conscious easily; they may then cease to be conscious, but  can become conscious once more without any trouble: as people say they can be repro- duced or remembered. This reminds us that consciousness is in general a very highly  fugitive condition. What is conscious is conscious only for a moment. . . . Everything  unconscious that can easily exchange the unconscious condition for the conscious one,  is therefor better described as “capable of entering consciousness,” or as preconscious.  Experience has taught us that there are hardly any mental processes, even of the most  complicated kind, which cannot on occasion remain preconscious, although as a rule  they press forward, as we say, into consciousness. There are other mental processes  or mental material which have no such easy access to consciousness, but which must  be inferred, discovered, and translated into conscious form in the manner that has been  described. It is for such material that we reserve the name of the unconscious proper.  Thus we have attributed three qualities to mental processes: they are either conscious,  preconscious, or unconscious. The division between the three classes is neither absolute  nor permanent. What is preconscious becomes conscious, as we have seen, without  any activity on our part; what is unconscious can, as a result of our efforts, be made  conscious, though in the process we may have an impression that we are overcoming  what are often very strong resistances. . . . A lowering of resistances of this sort, with a  consequent pressing forward of unconscious material, takes place regularly in the state  of sleep and thus brings about a necessary precondition for the formation of dreams. It is by no means an exaggeration to assert that the concept of the unconscious  forms the central core in Freud’s theory of the structure and dynamics of the human  personality. And though the conscious self has an important role to play in our lives, it  is the unconscious self that holds the greatest fascination for Freud, and which has the  dominant influence in our personalities. Freud’s focus on the unconscious self marks  a significant departure from previous efforts in philosophy to understand the nature of  the self, and in so doing, it challenges the traditional philosophical assumption that the  self can be explored and understood primarily through rational reflection and analysis.

When asked,  she can explain the rationale for her viewpoint, but she also respects differing  viewpoints that are supported by legitimate reasons, even though she feels her  viewpoint makes more sense. In addition, a Stage 3 thinker maintains an open  mind, always willing to consider new evidence that might convince her to modify  or even change her position. ",1686,949,,
phil.pdf,en,443,"For Kierkegaard, “objective knowing” can never achieve a genuine understanding  of God because it treats God as an object to be proved and understood—an impossible  task, given the limits of our reasoning capacities. “Subjective knowing,” on the other  hand, is the consequence of establishing a relationship with God by means of our leap of  faith, a connection founded on passion, not dispassionate rational understanding. The  objective knowing of reason can provide the illusion of understanding God, but this  way of knowing will always be an approximation, an idealized and distorted intellec- tual construction. Only by surrendering ourselves to subjective knowing, through the  leap of faith, can we achieve true knowledge of God through a personal relationship. ",771,775,,

Explain in your own words Kierkegaard’s reasoning  in the following passage, which concludes with a stunning metaphor: Without risk there is no faith. Faith is precisely the contradiction between the  infinite passion of the individual’s inwardness and the objective uncertainty.  If I am capable of grasping God objectively, I do not believe, but precisely  because I cannot do this I must believe. If I wish to preserve myself in faith I  must constantly be intent upon holding fast the objective uncertainty, so as  to remain out upon the deep, over seventy thousand fathoms of water, still  preserving my faith.

Objectively, reflection is directed to the  problem of whether this object is the true God; subjectively, reflection is directed to the  question whether the individual is related to a something in such a manner that his relation- ship is in truth a God-relationship. On which side is the truth now to be found? Ah, may we  not here resort to a mediation, and say: It is on neither side, but in the mediation of both?  Excellently well said, provided we might have it explained how an existing individual man- ages to be in a state of mediation. For to be in a state of mediation is to be finished, while  to exist is to become. Nor can an existing individual be in two places at the same time—he  cannot be an identity of subject and object. When he is nearest to being in two places at  the same time he is in passion; but passion is also the highest expression of subjectivity. ",929,828,,
phil.pdf,en,348,"The reason the empiricists were unable to see the contributions of the human  mind to constructing knowledge (and, conversely, the reason why rationalists were  unable to fully credit the contributions of sensory experience) was that the world and  our understanding of it is presented as an integrated package in which sensory experi- ence and the faculties of the mind have already created their epistemological synthesis.  As a result, we need to make an extraordinary effort to distinguish these two primary  contributors to the knowing process “until with long practice of attention we have  become skilled in separating it.” That was our goal in performing some of the simple  perceptual activities in the previous section, trying to slow the perceiving/believing/ knowing process down to become aware of the various sensory and thinking compo- nents in these processes. Let’s try a somewhat different approach that may prove to  be even more effective. Consider the (intentionally) ambiguous photograph in Figure 6.4.

Did they have different perceptions of  what was taking place and what would happen next? Very likely. How do you account  for these differences?

Instead, the “ultimate transformation” to which Buddhists aspire is to escape  the world of suffering through our own efforts until we finally achieve Nirvana (the  ultimate egoless state of bliss). The originator of Buddhism, Siddhartha Gautama, was born about 563 b.c.e., in  the foothills of the Himalayas in India. After renouncing his princely life, he embarked  on a spiritual quest that would transform him into a “Buddha,” an enlightened being.  This spiritual epiphany led to his developing the core beliefs on which Buddhism is  founded: the Four Noble Truths about suffering; the Eightfold Path for  liberation from suffering; the Wheel of Birth and Death; and Nirvana.  He began a wandering ministry that was to last forty-five years, gath- ering disciples—the sangha—and teaching the truths of reality—the  dharma—which revealed the path for each person’s state of spiritual  evolution. The foundation for Buddha’s religious philosophy is contained in  the Four Noble Truths of Suffering, from which all other dimensions  of his thinking flow. ",1148,877,,

In a view that  foreshadows that of David Hume, what we view as our continual  “I” is really a perpetually transient bundle of fleeting sensations,  impressions, ideas, and feelings.

phil.pdf,en,430,"And if we have supposed ourselves to know all about anything, and to be capable of  doing what is fit in regard to it, we naturally do not like to find that we are really ignorant  and powerless, that we have to begin again at the beginning, and try to learn what the  thing is and how it is to be dealt with—if indeed anything can be learnt about it. It is the  sense of power attached to a sense of knowledge that makes men desirous of believing,  and afraid of doubting. This sense of power is the highest and best of pleasures when the belief on which it  is founded is a true belief, and has been fairly earned by investigation. For then we may  justly feel that it is common property, and holds good for others as well as for ourselves.  Then we may be glad, not that I have learned secrets by which I am safer and stronger,  but that we men have got mastery over more of the world; and we shall be strong, not for  ourselves, but in the name of Man and his strength. But if the belief has been accepted  on insufficient evidence, the pleasure is a stolen one. Not only does it deceive ourselves  by giving us a sense of power which we do not really possess, but it is sinful, because  it is stolen in defiance of our duty to mankind. That duty is to guard ourselves from such  beliefs as from a pestilence, which may shortly master our own body and then spread  to the rest of the town. What would be thought of one who, for the sake of a sweet fruit,  should deliberately run the risk of bringing a plague upon his family and his neighbours? And, as in other such cases, it is not the risk only which has to be considered; for a  bad action is always bad at the time when it is done, no matter what happens afterwards.  Every time we let ourselves believe for unworthy reasons, we weaken our powers of  self-control, of doubting, of judicially and fairly weighing evidence. We all suffer severely  enough from the maintenance and support of false beliefs and the fatally wrong actions  which they lead to, and the evil born when one such belief is entertained is great and  wide. But a greater and wider evil arises when the credulous character is maintained  and supported, when a habit of believing for unworthy reasons is fostered and made  permanent. If I steal money from any person, there may be no harm done by the mere  transfer of possession; he may not feel the loss, or it may prevent him from using the  money badly. But I cannot help doing this great wrong towards Man, that I make myself  dishonest. What hurts society is not that it should lose its property, but that it should  become a den of thieves; for then it must cease to be society. This is why we ought not  to do evil that good may come; for at any rate this great evil has come, that we have  done evil and are made wicked thereby. In like manner, if I let myself believe anything  on insufficient evidence, there may be no great harm done by the mere belief; it may  be true after all, or I may never have occasion to exhibit it in outward acts. But I cannot  help doing this great wrong towards Man, that I make myself credulous. The danger to  society is not merely that it should believe wrong things, though that is great enough;  but that it should become credulous, and lose the habit of testing things and inquiring  into them; for then it must sink back into savagery. The harm which is done by credulity in a man is not confined to the fostering of a  credulous character in others, and consequent support of false beliefs. Habitual want of  care about what I believe leads to habitual want of care in others about the truth of what  is told to me. Men speak the truth to one another when each reveres the truth in his own  mind and in the other’s mind; but how shall my friend revere the truth in my mind when  I myself am careless about it, when I believe things because I want to believe them, and  because they are comforting and pleasant? Will he not learn to cry, “Peace,” to me, when  there is no peace? By such a course I shall surround myself with a thick atmosphere  of falsehood and fraud, and in that I must live. It may matter little to me, in my cloud- castle of sweet illusions and darling lies; but it matters much to Man that I have made  my neighbours ready to deceive. The credulous man is father to the liar and the cheat;  he lives in the bosom of this his family, and it is no marvel if he should become even as  they are. So closely are our duties knit together, that whoso shall keep the whole law,  and yet offend in one point, he is guilty of all. To sum up: it is wrong always, everywhere, and for anyone, to believe anything upon  insufficient evidence. ",4677,1676,,
phil.pdf,en,586,"Plato’s theory of the state is both structured and hierarchical. Once people have been  sorted into their respective groups, based on their intrinsic talents, they are typically  expected to remain in those social classes and work toward the good of the entire soci- ety. This may entail subsuming their own personal interests and preferences so that  society as a whole may flourish. Although Plato found it acceptable for people to move  within their social class, he cautioned that trying to move to another social class would do  harm to society as a whole, contributing to an unjust society. And because society and its  citizens have a close, reciprocal relationship with one another, such “wicked” behavior  would also threaten the happiness of the citizens. One area in which Plato considered  social mobility to be possible was in the search for members of the ruling class, those  men and women who were identified through a type of education as being intellectually  superior. In this regard, Socrates himself was a model, coming from a father who was a  sculptor and a mother who was a midwife to become the most revered thinker in Athens. For many people in the modern era who are committed to egalitarian values (every- one is intrinsically equal) and democratic principles (all people should have an equal voice  in governing), Plato’s ideas may seem wrongheaded and even offensive. But it is impor- tant to realize that Plato’s social and political views are a direct outgrowth of his entire  metaphysic and epistemology (which we explored in Chapter 5) as well as witnessing  “democracy” execute his mentor Socrates. For Plato’s hierarchy is not based on elitist or  aristocratic principles but is rather a hierarchy of wisdom and enlightenment, at least for  the ruling leaders. He believed that all people should strive to achieve a rationally based  understanding of the essence of truth and goodness. Using his Allegory of the Cave as a  framework, he urged that each person should escape from the enslavement of unreality,  and then seek to free the minds of those still submerged in the world of appearances. The people who are best equipped to rule are those who have earned the right  through the development of their rational intellects. In principle, this system of intel- lectual merit would not exclude anyone based on gender, race, or social class: The  sole criterion would be one’s developed wisdom. Of course, the practical application  of such an ideal would likely be very different, as everyone in Athens, like now, did  not have equal educational opportunities to reach higher stages of enlightenment.  Nevertheless, Plato was clear in his belief that women were as qualified as men to be  rulers and ought to share the same education as men to prepare them. Plato believed that for individuals to lead virtuous lives and attain happiness, they  needed to conform to their intrinsic natures and fulfill their unique potentials, goals that  could be achieved only within the context of a just, rationally ordered state. The natural  order is for people of wisdom to lead society, people of courage to protect its interests, and  people of temperance to provide the basic nourishing needs of the community.  Plato’s  ideal society is based on the concept of cooperation, a state in which all people fulfill their  distinctive functions, fully committed to the general interests of society as a whole.

phil.pdf,en,141,"The English philosopher—and physician—John Locke continued exploring the  themes Descartes had initiated, both in terms of the nature of knowledge (episte- mology) and the nature of the self. He shared with Descartes a scientist’s perspec- tive, seeking to develop knowledge based on clear thinking, rigorous analysis, and  real-world observation and experimentation. However, Locke brought a very differ- ent approach to this epistemological enterprise. Descartes believed that we could  use the power of reason to achieve absolutely certain knowledge of the world and  then use this rationally based knowledge to understand our world of experience. His  extensive work in mathematics served as a model, convincing him that there were  absolute truths and knowledge waiting to be discovered by reasoned, disciplined  reflection. Locke’s work as a physician, rather than a mathematician, provided him with a  very different perspective. The physician’s challenge is to gather information regard- ing the symptoms a patient is experiencing, and then relate these symptoms to his  (the physician’s) accumulated knowledge of disease. Although a successful doctor  uses sophisticated reasoning abilities in identifying patterns and making inferences,  his conclusions are grounded in experience. Knowledge, in other words, is based on  the careful observation of sense experience and/or memories of previous experi- ences. Reason plays a subsequent role in helping to figure out the significance of our  sense experience and to reach intelligent conclusions. To sum up: For Descartes, our reasoning ability provides the origin of knowledge  and final court of judgment in evaluating the accuracy and value of the ideas pro- duced. For Locke, all knowledge originates in our direct sense experience, which acts  as the final court of judgment in evaluating the accuracy and value of ideas. As a  result, Descartes is considered an archetypal proponent of the rationalist view of  knowledge, whereas Locke is considered an archetypal advocate of the empiricist  view of knowledge. These are themes that we will be exploring in depth in Chapters 5 and 6. For now,  we will focus on the way in which these contrasting approaches to the world influence  their views on the nature of the self. True to his philosophical commitment to grounding his ideas in sense experi- ence, Locke, in his essay entitled “On Personal Identity” (from his most famous work,  An Essay Concerning Human Understanding) engages in a reflective analysis of how we  experience our self in our everyday lives.

For example, we may have promised  our friend, “We will help you study whenever you need us,” and now feel that  we have to honor that promise even though we would much rather go to the  country. This is very different from the person who chooses not to honor his  promise to his friend, and instead goes to the country instead of helping his  friend study. Counterargument 2. Even if we derive some satisfaction from giving up our  trip to the country to help our friend, this is precisely what it means to act  “unselfishly”—acting to promote someone else’s interests, not just our own.  In contrast, the person who breaks his promise and goes to the country is  acting only to promote his own interest.

Therefore, the action is “unselfish” only at a superficial level of analy- sis. Smith will feel much better with himself for having stayed to help his friend—if he  had gone to the country, he would have felt terrible about it—and that is the real point  of the action.

Why? Because  Socrates had failed to demonstrate either remorse or respect for the power of the  court. It was customary for men facing the death penalty to take extreme measures,  pleading for mercy, covering themselves with dirt and tearing their clothes to symbol- ize their remorse, rolling on the ground while wailing in anguish. Further, they were  expected to acknowledge the authority of the court, speaking deferentially and dem- onstrating their utmost respect. Socrates did none of this. Instead, consistent with his  self-proclaimed role as a “gadfly,” he revealed the errors of their thinking in convicting  him and warned them against corrupting their souls if they didn’t act justly. Rather  than propose serious counterpenalties, he recommended that the court award him a  special honor for his years of service to Athens and provide him with a pension! Instead  of offering to pay a hefty fine, he suggested paying a comparatively miniscule amount   (a mina), which he asked his friends to increase to 30 minae. In short, Socrates dis- played clearly and entertainingly his total contempt for the bogus case that had been  brought against him and his moral disapproval of the role that the judges and jury  were playing in the personal vendetta against him. Not surprisingly, the court was not  amused, preferring to extinguish the gadfly rather than enduring its ongoing bites.

To use  a metaphor, you are an artist, creating your life portrait, and your paints and brush- strokes are the choices you make each day. How do you feel about the portrait you have  created so far? Have you defined yourself as the person you always wanted to be, or  are you a “work in progress”? Are you achieving your full potential as a human being,  “actively exercising your soul’s powers”—the ancient Greek definition of happiness  (eudaemonia)? Do you possess a clear philosophy of life that acts as a guiding beacon,  illuminating the whole of your life and showing you the path to wisdom and personal  fulfillment? Creating an enlightened self-portrait is your preeminent responsibility in  life, and though it is challenging work, it is well worth the effort.

We must embark on a philosophical journey, a process  of self-exploration and discovery, seeking answers to profound questions about our  lives and illuminating the mysteries of our existence. Each of us strives to live a life of  purpose, to fulfill our unique potential, and to achieve stellar accomplishments. It is  the remarkable capability of our minds to reflect deeply and thoughtfully—to think  philosophically—that enables us to pursue these goals.

In fact, although everyone is equal  (“all being kings as much as he, every man his equal”) the “greater part” of them  are not “strict observers of equity and justice.” As a result, “this state is very unsafe,  very unsecure,” and it is “full of fears and continual dangers.” It seems that Locke’s  utopian paradise has become more like Hobbes’s jungle. Faced with these unpleas- ant drawbacks of being a “king” among “kings,” individuals reason that it would be  in their self-interest to form a political state for the express purpose of ensuring that  God’s law of nature is effectively administered. Specifically: • The provisions of the law of nature need to be clearly articulated because, in the  “state of nature,” people’s inherent biases skew their understanding of the law. • Judges need to be appointed to arbitrate in the case of different interpretations  of the law, again because people are “partial to themselves” and “passion and  revenge” too often replace rational evaluation. • There needs to be sufficient power to enforce the law, because offenders rarely  accept their punishments passively.

It is this makes them so willingly give up every one  his single power of punishing, to be exercised by such alone, as shall be appointed to  it amongst them; and by such rules as the community, or those authorized by them to  that purpose, shall agree on. And in this we have the original right and rise of both the  legislative and executive power, as well as of the governments and societies themselves. ",969,828,,

A guilty verdict will result in a manda- tory death sentence. The case appears to be open and shut until one  juror challenges the others to move beyond their prejudices and pre- sumptions to address the facts before arriving at a decision. • Cool Hand Luke (1967) How can the spirit be free while the body is  imprisoned? When Luke Jackson is sent to prison camp, he refuses to  submit to the tyrannical authority of the camp’s captain. His repeated  escapes and attempts to bring meaning and fraternity to the other pris- oners only provoke the anger of the captain, who makes it his mission to  break Luke’s spirit. • Good Night, and Good Luck (2005) What methods are appropriate for  protesting injustice? Based on a true story, this film depicts the conflict  between journalist Edward R. Murrow and Senator Joseph McCarthy  during the anticommunist committee hearings of the 1950s—hearings  that destroyed the careers of many and created hysteria in the country.  In spite of pressure from his television  station to remain silent, as well as  threats that he would be the next target  of government investigation, Murrow  openly criticized and exposed the scare  tactics employed by the committee. • Malcolm X (1992) How can one find  meaning in an unjust world? Based  on the autobiography, this film follows  the life of the famous African American  leader. After his father is killed by the  Ku Klux Klan, Malcolm Little becomes  a gangster before discovering the  Nation of Islam while in prison. He  subsequently becomes a militant politi- cal activist fighting against racism for the rights of African Americans,  who advocated black pride, black power, identity politics, and economic  self-reliance.

phil.pdf,en,531,"But enough of metaphor and declamation: it is not by such means that moral science  is to be improved. The principle of utility is the foundation of the present work; it will be proper, therefore,  at the outset to give an explicit and determinate account of what is meant by it. By the  principle of utility is meant that principle which approves or disapproves of every action  whatsoever, according to the tendency which it appears to have to augment or diminish  the happiness of the party whose interest is in question; or what is the same thing in  other words, to promote or to oppose that happiness. I say of every action whatsoever;  and therefore not only of every action of a private individual, but of every measure of  government. By utility is meant that property in any object, whereby it tends to produce benefit,  advantage, pleasure, good, or happiness (all this in the present case comes to the same  thing) or (what comes again to the same thing) to prevent the happening of mischief,  pain, evil, or unhappiness of the party whose interest is considered: if that party be the  community in general, then the happiness of the community: if a particular individual,  then the happiness of that individual. The interest of the community is one of the most general expressions that can occur in  the phraseology of morals: no wonder that the meaning is often lost. When it has a mean- ing, it is this. The community is a fictitious body, composed of the individual persons who  are considered as constituting as it were its members. The interest of the community  then is, what?—the sum of the interests of the several members who compose it. . . . An action then may be said to be conformable to the principle of utility, or, for short- ness’ sake, to utility (meaning with respect to the community at large) when the tendency  it has to augment the happiness of the community is greater than any it has to diminish it.

phil.pdf,en,367,"We have seen in these last two chapters that “knowledge” and “truth” are com- plex and elusive entities. Although there are compelling reasons to view knowl- edge and truth as goals toward which we challenge ourselves to strive, many  people resist this insight. Either they take refuge in a belief in the absolute,  unchanging nature of knowledge and truth, as presented by the appropriate  authorities, or they conclude that there is no such thing as knowledge or truth  and that trying to seek either is a futile enterprise. In this latter view of the  world, known as relativism, all beliefs are considered to be “relative” to the per- son or context in which they arise. For the relativist, all opinions are equal in  truth to all others; we are never in a position to say with confidence that one  view is right and another view is wrong. Although a relativistic view is appro- priate in some areas of experience—for example, in matters of taste such as  fashion—in many other areas it is not. Knowledge in the form of well-supported  beliefs is often difficult to achieve, but it does exist in some form. Some beliefs  are better than others, not because an authority has proclaimed them so but because they  can be analyzed and evaluated in terms of the criteria we described above. Each day we are called on to solve difficult problems, analyze tangled issues, and  sift through a tidal wave of information. We are expected to make intelligent deci- sions, negotiate our way through a jungle of relationships, and communicate our ideas  clearly and persuasively. It’s no wonder that we often feel overmatched, unable to  marshal the thinking abilities needed to succeed in all of these demanding contexts.  Here, for example, are a few of the issues that appear daily in the media and about  which we, as thoughtful and concerned citizens, ought to develop informed opinions: On Cloning Humans and Genetic Engineering, “Never” Turns Swiftly into  “Why Not?”: There has been an enormous change in attitudes since Dolly the lamb  became the first animal cloned from a cell taken from an adult. Contrary to early  fears of a Brave New World, scientists have become sanguine about the notion of  cloning human beings. The frenzy seems to have died down. Some infertility centers  are already conducting experiments with human eggs that lay the groundwork for  cloning. Ultimately, scientists expect cloning to be combined with genetic enhance- ment, adding genes to give desired traits. As another dimension of the cloning  controversy, the genetic engineering of animals for food has recently become a major  issue, raising both health concerns and also ethical questions regarding whether we  have the “right” to tamper with nature in this way.

phil.pdf,en,566,"You have already grasped that Sisyphus is the absurd hero. He is, as  much through his passions as through his torture. His scorn of the gods, his  hatred of death, and his passion for life won him that unspeakable penalty in  which the whole being is exerted toward accomplishing nothing. This is the  price that must be paid for the passions of this earth. Nothing is told us about  Sisyphus in the underworld. Myths are made for the imagination to breathe  life into them. As for this myth, one sees merely the whole effort of a body  straining to raise the huge stone, to roll it, and push it up a slope a hundred  times over; one sees the face screwed up, the cheek tight against the stone,  the shoulder bracing the clay-covered mass, the foot wedging it, the fresh  start with arms outstretched, the wholly human security of two earth-clotted  hands. At the very end of his long effort measured by skyless space and time  without depth, the purpose is achieved. Then Sisyphus watches the stone  rush down in a few moments toward that lower world whence he will have to  push it up again toward the summit. He goes back down to the plain. It is during that return, that pause, that Sisyphus interests me. A face that  toils so close to stones is already stone itself! I see that man going back down  with a heavy yet measured step toward the torment of which he will never  know the end. That hour like a breathing-space which returns as surely as his  suffering, that is the hour of consciousness. At each of those moments when  he leaves the heights and gradually sinks toward the lairs of the gods, he is superior to  his fate. He is stronger than his rock. If this myth is tragic, that is because its hero is conscious. Where would his torture  be, indeed, if at every step the hope of succeeding upheld him? The workman of today  works everyday in his life at the same tasks, and his fate is no less absurd. But it is tragic  only at the rare moments when it becomes conscious. Sisyphus, proletarian of the gods,  powerless and rebellious, knows the whole extent of his wretched condition: it is what he  thinks of during his descent. The lucidity that was to constitute his torture at the same  time crowns his victory. There is no fate that cannot be surmounted by scorn. If the descent is thus sometimes performed in sorrow, it can also take place in joy. This  word is not too much. Again I fancy Sisyphus returning toward his rock, and the sorrow  was in the beginning. When the images of earth cling too tightly to memory, when the call  of happiness becomes too insistent, it happens that melancholy arises in man’s heart: this  is the rock’s victory, this is the rock itself. The boundless grief is too heavy to bear. These  are our nights of Gethsemane. But crushing truths perish from being acknowledged. Thus,  Oedipus at the outset obeys fate without knowing it. But from the moment he knows, his  tragedy begins. Yet at the same moment, blind and desperate, he realizes that the only  bond linking him to the world is the cool hand of a girl. Then a tremendous remark rings  out: “Despite so many ordeals, my advanced age and the nobility of my soul make me  conclude that all is well.” Sophocles’ Oedipus, like Dostoevsky’s Kirilov, thus gives the  recipe for the absurd victory. Ancient wisdom confirms modern heroism. One does not discover the absurd without being tempted to write a manual of happi- ness. “What! by such narrow ways—?” There is but one world, however. Happiness and  the absurd are two sons of the same earth. They are inseparable. It would be a mistake  to say that happiness necessarily springs from the absurd discovery. It happens as well  that the feeling of the absurd springs from happiness. “I conclude that all is well,” says  Oedipus, and that remark is sacred. It echoes in the wild and limited universe of man.  It teaches that all is not, has not been, exhausted. It drives out of this world a god who  had come into it with dissatisfaction and a preference for futile suffering. It makes of fate  a human matter, which must be settled among men. All Sisyphus’ silent joy is contained therein. His fate belongs to him. His rock is a thing.  Likewise, the absurd man, when he contemplates his torment, silences all the idols. In the  universe suddenly restored to its silence, the myriad wondering little voices of the earth rise  up. Unconscious, secret calls, invitations from all the faces, they are the necessary reverse  and price of victory. There is no sun without shadow, and it is essential to know the night.  ",4577,1680,,
phil.pdf,en,40,"• To what extent are your beliefs supported by sound reasons and compelling evidence  derived from reliable sources? Everybody has beliefs; the accuracy and usefulness  of our beliefs are determined by the strength and relevance of the reasons and  evidence that support these beliefs. A simple test for this is to ask yourself why  you have the beliefs you do. If your beliefs are well grounded, you should be able  to provide a clear explanation of the reasons and evidence that led you to your  beliefs. If you are not able to provide this sort of compelling justification, that’s a  warning sign that you need to do some more investigation. • How effectively do your beliefs help you predict what will happen in the future?   Beliefs that explain what happened in the past have value, but beliefs that  are able to predict what will happen in the future have even more. Predicting  the  future provides much more compelling evidence for beliefs than simply   providing an account of past events, an explanation that may be difficult to prove  one way or another. • To what extent are your beliefs falsifiable? Another important criterion for evalu- ating your beliefs is whether the beliefs are falsifiable. This means that you can  state conditions—tests—under which the beliefs could be disproved, and the  beliefs nevertheless pass those tests. For example, if you believe that you can cre- ate ice cubes by placing water-filled trays in a freezer, it is easy to see how you can  conduct an experiment to determine if your belief is accurate. If you believe that  your destiny is related to the positions of the planets and stars (as astrologers do),  it is not clear how you can conduct an experiment to determine if your belief is  accurate. Because a belief that is not falsifiable can never be proved, such a belief  is of questionable accuracy. ",1857,998,,
phil.pdf,en,40,"A critical thinker sees knowledge and truth as goals that we are striving to achieve,  processes that we are all actively involved in as we construct our understanding of  the world. Developing accurate knowledge about the world is often a challenging  process of exploration and analysis in which our understanding grows and evolves  over a period of time. The road to becoming a critical thinker is a challenging journey that involves pass- ing through different stages of critical thinking in order to achieve an effective under- standing of the world. These stages, ranging from simple to complex, characterize  people’s thinking and the way they understand their world. A critical thinker is a  person who has progressed through all of the stages to achieve a sophisticated under- standing of the nature of knowledge. This framework is based on the work of Harvard  psychologist William Perry (Forms of Intellectual and Ethical Development in the College  Years: A Scheme), who used in-depth research to create a developmental model of  human thought. This text uses a condensed three-stage version of Perry’s framework: An individual may be at different stages simultaneously, depending on the subject or  area of experience. For example, a person may be at an advanced stage in one area  of life (academic work) but at a less sophisticated stage in another area (romantic  relationships or conception of morality). In general, however, people tend to operate  predominantly within one stage in most areas of their lives. ",1528,910,,

phys.pdf,en,223,"Newton’s first law is general and can be applied to anything from an object sliding on a table to a satellite in orbit to blood pumped from the heart. Experiments have verified that any change in velocity (speed or direction) must be caused by an external force. The idea of generally applicable or universal laws is important—it is a basic feature of all laws of physics. Identifying these laws is like recognizing patterns in nature from which further patterns can be discovered. The genius of Galileo, who first developed the idea for the first law of motion, and Newton, who clarified it, was to ask the fundamental question: “What is the cause?” Thinking in terms of cause and effect is fundamentally different from the typical ancient Greek approach, when questions such as “Why does a tiger have stripes?” would have been answered in Aristotelian fashion, such as “That is the nature of the beast.” The ability to think in terms of cause and effect is the ability to make a connection between an observed behavior and the surrounding world. Gravitation and Inertia Regardless of the scale of an object, whether a molecule or a subatomic particle, two properties remain valid and thus of interest to physics: gravitation and inertia. Both are connected to mass. Roughly speaking, mass is a measure of the amount of matter in something. Gravitation is the attraction of one mass to another, such as the attraction between yourself and Earth that holds your feet to the floor. The magnitude of this attraction is your weight, and it is a force. ",1549,932,,
phys.pdf,en,223,"Mass is also related to inertia, the ability of an object to resist changes in its motion—in other words, to resist acceleration. Newton’s first law is often called the law of inertia. As we know from experience, some objects have more inertia than others. It is more difficult to change the motion of a large boulder than that of a basketball, for example, because the boulder has more mass than the basketball. In other words, the inertia of an object is measured by its mass. The relationship between mass and weight is explored later in this chapter. Inertial Reference Frames Earlier, we stated Newton’s first law as “A body at rest remains at rest or, if in motion, remains in motion at constant velocity unless acted on by a net external force.” It can also be stated as “Every body remains in its state of uniform motion in a straight line unless it is compelled to change that state by forces acting on it.” To Newton, “uniform motion in a straight line” meant constant velocity, which includes the case of zero velocity, or rest. Therefore, the first law says that the velocity of an object remains constant if the net force on it is zero. ",1150,861,,
phys.pdf,en,223,"Newton’s first law is usually considered to be a statement about reference frames. It provides a method for identifying a special type of reference frame: the inertial reference frame. In principle, we can make the net force on a body zero. If its velocity relative to a given frame is constant, then that frame is said to be inertial. So by definition, an inertial reference frame is a reference frame in which Newton’s first law is valid. Newton’s first law applies to objects with constant velocity. From this fact, we can infer the following statement. ",557,735,,

phys.pdf,en,236,"• Explain the difference between mass and weight • Explain why falling objects on Earth are never truly in free fall • Describe the concept of weightlessness Mass and weight are often used interchangeably in everyday conversation. For example, our medical records often show our weight in kilograms but never in the correct units of newtons. In physics, however, there is an important distinction. Weight is the pull of Earth on an object. It depends on the distance from the center of Earth. Unlike weight, mass does not vary with location. The mass of an object is the same on Earth, in orbit, or on the surface of the Moon. Units of Force The equation Fnet = ma is used to define net force in terms of mass, length, and time. As explained earlier, the SI unit of Although almost the entire world uses the newton for the unit of force, in the United States, the most familiar unit of force is the pound (lb), where 1 N = 0.225 lb. Thus, a 225-lb person weighs 1000 N. Weight and Gravitational Force When an object is dropped, it accelerates toward the center of Earth. Newton’s second law says that a net force on an object is responsible for its acceleration. If air resistance is negligible, the net force on a falling object is the gravitational force, commonly called its weight w → , or its force due to gravity acting on an object of mass m. Weight can be denoted as a vector because it has a direction; down is, by definition, the direction of gravity, and hence, weight is a downward force. The magnitude of weight is denoted as w. Galileo was instrumental in showing that, in the absence of air resistance, all objects fall with the same acceleration g. Using Galileo’s result and Newton’s second law, we can derive an equation for weight. ",1751,1003,,

phys.pdf,en,622,"Elasticity is the tendency of solid objects and materials to return to their original shape after the external forces (load) causing a deformation are removed. An object is elastic when it comes back to its original size and shape when the load is no longer present. Physical reasons for elastic behavior vary among materials and depend on the microscopic structure of the material. For example, the elasticity of polymers and rubbers is caused by stretching polymer chains under an applied force. In contrast, the elasticity of metals is caused by resizing and reshaping the crystalline cells of the lattices (which are the material structures of metals) under the action of externally applied forces. ",703,754,,
phys.pdf,en,622,"The two parameters that determine the elasticity of a material are its elastic modulus and its elastic limit. A high elastic modulus is typical for materials that are hard to deform; in other words, materials that require a high load to achieve a significant strain. An example is a steel band. A low elastic modulus is typical for materials that are easily deformed under a load; for example, a rubber band. If the stress under a load becomes too high, then when the load is removed, the material no longer comes back to its original shape and size, but relaxes to a different shape and size: The material becomes permanently deformed. The elastic limit is the stress value beyond which the material no longer behaves elastically but becomes permanently deformed. ",765,771,,

The horizontal displacement of the lawn mower, over which the force acts, is d→ .

Note also that the maximum height depends only on the vertical component of the initial velocity, so that any projectile with a 67.6-m/s initial vertical component of velocity reaches a maximum height of 233 m (neglecting air resistance). The numbers in this example are reasonable for large fireworks displays, the shells of which do reach such heights before exploding. In practice, air resistance is not completely negligible, so the initial velocity would have to be somewhat larger than that given to reach the same height. ",689,752,,

If you are able to see the launch of fireworks, notice that several seconds pass before the shell explodes. Another way of finding the time is by using y = y0 + 1 2(v0y + vy)t.

The hip is a ball (at the end of the femur) and socket (part of the pelvis) joint. The ends of the bones in the joint are covered by cartilage, which provides a smooth, almost-glassy surface.

There is no information given in this example about the individual external forces acting on the system, but we can say something about their relative magnitudes. For example, the force exerted by the person pushing the mower must be greater than the friction opposing the motion (since we know the mower moved forward), and the vertical forces must cancel because no acceleration occurs in the vertical direction (the mower is moving only horizontally).

Similarly, the first overtone has λ = 4L/3 (see Figure 17.22), so that Because f3 = 3f1, we call the first overtone the third harmonic. Continuing this process, we see a pattern that can be where f1 is the fundamental, f3 is the first overtone, and so on.

phys.pdf,en,385,"In these examples, we were able to use conservation of energy to calculate the speed of a particle just at particular points in its motion. But the method of analyzing particle motion, starting from energy conservation, is more powerful than that. More advanced treatments of the theory of mechanics allow you to calculate the full time dependence of a particle’s motion, for a given potential energy. In fact, it is often the case that a better model for particle motion is provided by the form of its kinetic and potential energies, rather than an equation for force acting on it. (This is especially true for the quantum mechanical description of particles like electrons or atoms.) We can illustrate some of the simplest features of this energy-based approach by considering a particle in one-dimensional motion, with potential energy U(x) and no non-conservative interactions present. Equation 8.12 and the definition of velocity require Separate the variables x and t and integrate, from an initial time t = 0 to an arbitrary time, to get Use the potential energy U(x) = −E⎛ ⎝x/x0 ⎞ ⎠, for E > 0, in Equation 8.14 to find the position x of a particle Since we know how the potential energy changes as a function of x, we can substitute for U(x) in Equation 8.14, integrate, and then solve for x.

Similarly, a 60-cal serving of corn followed by a 200-cal serving of donuts gives 60 cal + 200 cal = 260 cal of energy. When we multiply a scalar quantity by a number, we obtain the same scalar quantity but with a larger (or smaller) value. For example, if yesterday’s breakfast had 200 cal of energy and today’s breakfast has four times as much energy as it had yesterday, then today’s breakfast has 4(200 cal) = 800 cal of energy. Two scalar quantities can also be multiplied or divided by each other to form a derived scalar quantity.

Fluids do not have appreciable shear strength, and for this reason, the sound waves in them are longitudinal waves. Sound in solids can have both longitudinal and transverse components, such as those in a seismic wave. Earthquakes generate seismic waves under Earth’s surface with both longitudinal and transverse components (called compressional or P-waves and shear or S-waves, respectively).

Therefore, the mechanical energy of the system is conserved, as represented by Equation 8.13, 0 = Δ(K + U) . Because the particle starts from rest, the increase in the kinetic energy is just the kinetic energy at the lowest point.

When they speak of “weightlessness” and “microgravity,” they are referring to the phenomenon we call “free fall” in physics.

The quantity or amount of matter of an object is determined by the numbers of atoms and molecules of various types it contains. Because these numbers do not vary, in Newtonian physics, mass does not vary; therefore, its response to an applied force does not vary. In contrast, weight is the gravitational force acting on an object, so it does vary depending on gravity.

If we consider situations in which g→ is a constant on Earth, we see that weight w → is directly proportional to mass m, since w → = m g→ , that is, the more massive an object is, the more it weighs. Operationally, the masses of objects are determined by comparison with the standard kilogram, as we discussed in Units and Measurement.

The molecules of the ﬂuid simply ﬂow to accommodate the horizontal force. A force applied perpendicular to the surface compresses or expands the fluid. If you try to compress a fluid, you find that a reaction force develops at each point inside the fluid in the outward direction, balancing the force applied on the molecules at the boundary.

Chemistry, for example—since it deals with the interactions of atoms and molecules—has close ties to atomic and molecular physics. Most branches of engineering are concerned with designing new technologies, processes, or structures within the constraints set by the laws of physics. In architecture, physics is at the heart of structural stability and is involved in the acoustics, heating, lighting, and cooling of buildings. Parts of geology rely heavily on physics, such as radioactive dating of rocks, earthquake analysis, and heat transfer within Earth. Some disciplines, such as biophysics and geophysics, are hybrids of physics and other disciplines. ",749,762,,

Notice the similarity in the equations for vorbit and vesc . The escape velocity is exactly 2 times greater, about 40%, than the orbital velocity.

In fact, they are in free fall. Consider the trajectories shown in Figure 13.13. (This figure is based on a drawing by Newton in his Principia and also appeared earlier in Motion in Two and Three Dimensions.) All the trajectories shown that hit the surface of Earth have less than orbital velocity. The astronauts would accelerate toward Earth along the noncircular paths shown and feel weightless. (Astronauts actually train for life in orbit by riding in airplanes that free fall for 30 seconds at a time.) But with the correct orbital velocity, Earth’s surface curves away from them at exactly the same rate as they fall toward Earth.

The result is vesc = 4.21 × 104 m/s or about 42 The speed needed to escape the Sun (leave the solar system) is nearly four times the escape speed from Earth’s surface. But there is help in both cases. Earth is rotating, at a speed of nearly 1.7 km/s at the equator, and we can use that velocity to help escape, or to achieve orbit. For this reason, many commercial space companies maintain launch facilities near the equator. To escape the Sun, there is even more help. Earth revolves about the Sun at a speed of approximately 30 km/s. By launching in the direction that Earth is moving, we need only an additional 12 km/s. The use of gravitational assist from other planets, essentially a gravity slingshot technique, allows space probes to reach even greater speeds. In this slingshot technique, the vehicle approaches the planet and is accelerated by the planet’s gravitational attraction. It has its greatest speed at the closest point of approach, although it decelerates in equal measure as it moves away. But relative to the planet, the vehicle’s speed far before the approach, and long after, are the same. If the directions are chosen correctly, that can result in a significant increase (or decrease if needed) in the vehicle’s speed relative to the rest of the solar system. ",1430,955,,

phys.pdf,en,887,"Many wind instruments are modified tubes that have finger holes, valves, and other devices for changing the length of the resonating air column and hence, the frequency of the note played. Horns producing very low frequencies require tubes so long that they are coiled into loops. An example is the tuba. Whether an overtone occurs in a simple tube or a musical instrument depends on how it is stimulated to vibrate and the details of its shape. The trombone, for example, does not produce its fundamental frequency and only makes overtones. ",542,731,,
phys.pdf,en,887,"If you have two tubes with the same fundamental frequency, but one is open at both ends and the other is closed at one end, they would sound different when played because they have different overtones. Middle C, for example, would sound richer played on an open tube, because it has even multiples of the fundamental as well as odd. A closed tube has only odd multiples. Resonance Resonance occurs in many different systems, including strings, air columns, and atoms. As we discussed in earlier chapters, resonance is the driven or forced oscillation of a system at its natural frequency. At resonance, energy is transferred rapidly to the oscillating system, and the amplitude of its oscillations grows until the system can no longer be described by Hooke’s law. An example of this is the distorted sound intentionally produced in certain types of rock music. ",861,794,,

The vibrating string creates a sound that resonates in the sounding box, greatly amplifying the sound and creating overtones that give the instrument its characteristic timbre. The more complex the shape of the sounding box, the greater its ability to resonate over a wide range of frequencies. The marimba, like the one shown in Figure 17.28, uses pots or gourds below the wooden slats to amplify their tones. The resonance of the pot can be adjusted by adding water. ",786,782,,
phys.pdf,en,700,"Specific gravity, being dimensionless, provides a ready comparison among materials without having to worry about the unit of density. For instance, the density of aluminum is 2.7 in g/cm3 (2700 in kg/m3 ), but its specific gravity is 2.7, regardless of the unit of density. Specific gravity is a particularly useful quantity with regard to buoyancy, which we will discuss later in this chapter. Pressure You have no doubt heard the word ‘pressure’ used in relation to blood (high or low blood pressure) and in relation to weather (high- and low-pressure weather systems). These are only two of many examples of pressure in fluids. (Recall that we introduced the idea of pressure in Static Equilibrium and Elasticity, in the context of bulk stress and strain.) To define the pressure at a specific point, the pressure is defined as the force dF exerted by a fluid over an infinitesimal A given force can have a significantly different effect, depending on the area over which the force is exerted. For instance, a force applied to an area of 1 mm2 has a pressure that is 100 times as great as the same force applied to an area of 1 cm2. That is why a sharp needle is able to poke through skin when a small force is exerted, but applying the same force with a finger does not puncture the skin (Figure 14.5). ",1307,912,,

He’d really done something to be proud  of now – no one could say he was just a famous name any more.  The evening air had never smelled so sweet. He walked over the  damp grass, reliving the last hour in his head, which was a happy  blur: Gryffindors running to lift him on to their shoulders; Ron  and Hermione in the distance, jumping up and down, Ron cheer- ing through a heavy nosebleed.  Harry had reached the shed. He leant against the wooden door  and looked up at Hogwarts, with its windows glowing red in the  setting sun. Gryffindor in the lead. He’d done it, he’d shown   Snape …  And speaking of Snape …  A hooded figure came swiftly down the front steps of the castle.  Clearly not wanting to be seen, it walked as fast as possible  towards the Forbidden Forest. Harry’s victory faded from his mind  as he watched. He recognised the figure’s prowling walk. Snape,  sneaking into the Forest while everyone else was at dinner – what  was going on?  Harry jumped back on his Nimbus Two Thousand and took off.  Gliding silently over the castle he saw Snape enter the Forest at a  run. He followed.  The trees were so thick he couldn’t see where Snape had gone.  He flew in circles, lower and lower, brushing the top branches of  trees until he heard voices. He glided towards them and landed  noiselessly in a towering beech tree.  He climbed carefully along one of the branches, holding tight  to his broomstick, trying to see through the leaves.  Below, in a shadowy clearing, stood Snape, but he wasn’t alone.  Quirrell was there, too. Harry couldn’t make out the look on his  face, but he was stuttering worse than ever. Harry strained to   catch what they were saying.  ‘… d-don’t know why you wanted t-t-to meet here of all p- places, Severus …’  ‘Oh, I thought we’d keep this private,’ said Snape, his voice icy.  ‘Students aren’t supposed to know about the Philosopher’s Stone,  after all.’  Harry leant forward.

He sprinted back upstairs.  ‘Did you get it?’ Ron asked as Harry joined them. ‘What’s the  matter?’  In a low whisper, Harry told them what he’d seen.  ‘You know what this means?’ he finished breathlessly. ‘He tried  to get past that three-headed dog at Hallowe’en! That’s where he  was going when we saw him – he’s after whatever it’s guarding!

I wouldn’t put anything past  Snape. But what’s he after? What’s that dog guarding?’  Harry went to bed with his head buzzing with the same ques- tion.

Behind the glass, all  sorts of lizards and snakes were crawling and slithering over bits  of wood and stone. Dudley and Piers wanted to see huge, poison- ous cobras and thick, man-crushing pythons. Dudley quickly  found the largest snake in the place. It could have wrapped its  body twice around Uncle Vernon’s car and crushed it into a dust- bin – but at the moment it didn’t look in the mood. In fact, it was  fast asleep.  Dudley stood with his nose pressed against the glass, staring at  the glistening brown coils.  ‘Make it move,’ he whined at his father. Uncle Vernon tapped  on the glass, but the snake didn’t budge.  ‘Do it again,’ Dudley ordered. Uncle Vernon rapped the glass  smartly with his knuckles, but the snake just snoozed on.  ‘This is boring,’ Dudley moaned. He shuffled away.

Or have the planets not let  you in on that secret? I set myself against what is lurking in this  Forest, Bane, yes, with humans alongside me if I must.’  And Firenze whisked around; with Harry clutching on as best  he could, they plunged off into the trees, leaving Ronan and Bane  behind them.

Wood cleared his throat for silence.  ‘OK, men,’ he said.  ‘And women,’ said Chaser Angelina Johnson.  ‘And women,’ Wood agreed. ‘This is it.’  ‘The big one,’ said Fred Weasley.  ‘The one we’ve all been waiting for,’ said George.  ‘We know Oliver’s speech by heart,’ Fred told Harry. ‘We were  in the team last year.’  ‘Shut up, you two,’ said Wood. ‘This is the best team  Gryffindor’s had in years. We’re going to win. I know it.’  He glared at them all as if to say, ‘Or else.’  ‘Right. It’s time. Good luck, all of you.’  Harry followed Fred and George out of the changing room and,  hoping his knees weren’t going to give way, walked on to the pitch  to loud cheers.  Madam Hooch was refereeing. She stood in the middle of the  pitch, waiting for the two teams, her broom in her hand.  ‘Now, I want a nice fair game, all of you,’ she said, once they  were all gathered around her. Harry noticed that she seemed to be  speaking particularly to the Slytherin captain, Marcus Flint, a   fifth-year. Harry thought Flint looked as if he had some troll   blood in him. Out of the corner of his eye he saw the fluttering  banner high above, flashing Potter for President over the crowd.   His heart skipped. He felt braver.  ‘Mount your brooms, please.’  Harry clambered on to his Nimbus Two Thousand.  ",2087,1155,,
potter.pdf,en,59,"Griphook held the door open for them. Harry, who had expected  more marble, was surprised. They were in a narrow stone passage- way lit with flaming torches. It sloped steeply downwards and  there were little railway tracks on the floor. Griphook whistled  and a small cart came hurtling up the tracks towards them. They  climbed in – Hagrid with some difficulty – and were off.  At first they just hurtled through a maze of twisting passages.  Harry tried to remember, left, right, right, left, middle fork, right,  left, but it was impossible. The rattling cart seemed to know its  own way, because Griphook wasn’t steering.  Harry’s eyes stung as the cold air rushed past them, but he kept  them wide open. Once, he thought he saw a burst of fire at the end  of a passage and twisted around to see if it was a dragon, but too late  – they plunged even deeper, passing an underground lake where  huge stalactites and stalagmites grew from the ceiling and floor.  ‘I never know,’ Harry called to Hagrid over the noise of the cart,  ‘what’s the difference between a stalagmite and a stalactite?’  ‘Stalagmite’s got an “m” in it,’ said Hagrid. ‘An’ don’ ask me  questions just now, I think I’m gonna be sick.’  He did look very green and when the cart stopped at last beside  a small door in the passage wall, Hagrid got out and had to lean  against the wall to stop his knees trembling.  Griphook unlocked the door. A lot of green smoke came bil- lowing out, and as it cleared, Harry gasped. Inside were mounds   of gold coins. Columns of silver. Heaps of little bronze Knuts.  ‘All yours,’ smiled Hagrid.  All Harry’s – it was incredible. The Dursleys couldn’t have  known about this or they’d have had it from him faster than  blinking. How often had they complained how much Harry cost  them to keep? And all the time there had been a small fortune  belonging to him, buried deep under London.  Hagrid helped Harry pile some of it into a bag.  ‘The gold ones are Galleons,’ he explained. ‘Seventeen silver  Sickles to a Galleon and twenty-nine Knuts to a Sickle, it’s easy  enough. Right, that should be enough fer a couple o’ terms, we’ll  keep the rest safe for yeh.’ He turned to Griphook. ‘Vault seven  hundred and thirteen now, please, and can we go more slowly?’  ‘One speed only,’ said Griphook.  They were going even deeper now and gathering speed. The air  became colder and colder as they hurtled round tight corners.  ",2432,1236,,
potter.pdf,en,175,"They looked at each other.  ‘We’ve got the Invisibility Cloak,’ said Harry. ‘It shouldn’t be too  difficult – I think the Cloak’s big enough to cover two of us and  Norbert.’  It was a mark of how bad the last week had been that the other  two agreed with him. Anything to get rid of Norbert – and Malfoy.  *  There was a hitch. By next morning, Ron’s bitten hand had  swollen to twice its usual size. He didn’t know whether it was safe  to go to Madam Pomfrey – would she recognise a dragon bite? By  the afternoon, though, he had no choice. The cut had turned a  nasty shade of green. It looked as if Norbert’s fangs were poiso- nous.  Harry and Hermione rushed up to the hospital wing at the end  of the day to find Ron in a terrible state in bed.  ‘It’s not just my hand,’ he whispered, ‘although that feels like it’s  about to fall off. Malfoy told Madam Pomfrey he wanted to bor- row one of my books so he could come and have a good laugh at  me. He kept threatening to tell her what really bit me – I’ve told  her it was a dog but I don’t think she believes me – I shouldn’t  have hit him at the Quidditch match, that’s why he’s doing this.’  Harry and Hermione tried to calm Ron down.  ‘It’ll all be over at midnight on Saturday,’ said Hermione, but  this didn’t soothe Ron at all. On the contrary, he sat bolt upright  and broke into a sweat.  ‘Midnight on Saturday!’ he said in a hoarse voice. ‘Oh no – oh  no – I’ve just remembered – Charlie’s letter was in that book  Malfoy took, he’s going to know we’re getting rid of Norbert.’  Harry and Hermione didn’t get a chance to answer. Madam  Pomfrey came over at that moment and made them leave, saying  Ron needed sleep.  *  ‘It’s too late to change the plan now,’ Harry told Hermione. ‘We  haven’t got time to send Charlie another owl and this could be   our only chance to get rid of Norbert. We’ll have to risk it. And   we have got the Invisibility Cloak, Malfoy doesn’t know about  that.’  They found Fang the boarhound sitting outside with a ban- daged tail when they went to tell Hagrid, who opened a window   to talk to them.  ",2095,1167,,
potter.pdf,en,115,"Fred and George Weasley now came into the hall, spotted  Harry and hurried over.  ‘Well done,’ said George in a low voice. ‘Wood told us. We’re on  the team too – Beaters.’  ‘I tell you, we’re going to win that Quidditch Cup for sure this  year,’ said Fred. ‘We haven’t won since Charlie left, but this year’s  team is going to be brilliant. You must be good, Harry, Wood was  almost skipping when he told us.’  ‘Anyway, we’ve got to go, Lee Jordan reckons he’s found a new  secret passageway out of the school.’  ‘Bet it’s that one behind the statue of Gregory the Smarmy that  we found in our first week. See you.’  Fred and George had hardly disappeared when someone far less  welcome turned up: Malfoy, flanked by Crabbe and Goyle.  ‘Having a last meal, Potter? When are you getting the train   back to the Muggles?’  ‘You’re a lot braver now you’re back on the ground and you’ve  got your little friends with you,’ said Harry coolly. There was of  course nothing at all little about Crabbe and Goyle, but as the  High Table was full of teachers, neither of them could do more  than crack their knuckles and scowl.  ‘I’d take you on any time on my own,’ said Malfoy. ‘Tonight, if  you want. Wizard’s duel. Wands only – no contact. What’s the  matter? Never heard of a wizard’s duel before, I suppose?’  ‘Of course he has,’ said Ron, wheeling round. ‘I’m his second,  who’s yours?’  Malfoy looked at Crabbe and Goyle, sizing them up.  ‘Crabbe,’ he said. ‘Midnight all right? We’ll meet you in the  trophy room, that’s always unlocked.’  When Malfoy had gone, Ron and Harry looked at each other.  ‘What is a wizard’s duel?’ said Harry. ‘And what do you mean,  you’re my second?’  ‘Well, a second’s there to take over if you die,’ said Ron casually,  getting started at last on his cold pie. Catching the look on Harry’s  face, he added quickly, ‘but people only die in proper duels, you  know, with real wizards. The most you and Malfoy’ll be able to do  is send sparks at each other. Neither of you knows enough magic  to do any real damage. I bet he expected you to refuse, anyway.’  ‘And what if I wave my wand and nothing happens?’  ‘Throw it away and punch him on the nose,’ Ron suggested.  ",2198,1208,,
potter.pdf,en,158,"Harry thought. Then he said slowly, ‘It shows us what we want  … whatever we want …’  ‘Yes and no,’ said Dumbledore quietly. ‘It shows us nothing  more or less than the deepest, most desperate desire of our hearts.  You, who have never known your family, see them standing  around you. Ronald Weasley, who has always been overshadowed  by his brothers, sees himself standing alone, the best of all of  them. However, this mirror will give us neither knowledge or  truth. Men have wasted away before it, entranced by what they  have seen, or been driven mad, not knowing if what it shows is  real or even possible.  ‘The Mirror will be moved to a new home tomorrow, Harry, and  I ask you not to go looking for it again. If you ever do run across   it, you will now be prepared. It does not do to dwell on dreams  and forget to live, remember that. Now, why don’t you put that  admirable Cloak back on and get off to bed?’  Harry stood up.  ‘Sir – Professor Dumbledore? Can I ask you something?’  ‘Obviously, you’ve just done so,’ Dumbledore smiled. ‘You may  ask me one more thing, however.’  ‘What do you see when you look in the Mirror?’  ‘I? I see myself holding a pair of thick, woollen socks.’  Harry stared.  ‘One can never have enough socks,’ said Dumbledore. ‘Another  Christmas has come and gone and I didn’t get a single pair. People  will insist on giving me books.’  It was only when he was back in bed that it struck Harry that  Dumbledore might not have been quite truthful. But then, he  thought, as he shoved Scabbers off his pillow, it had been quite a  personal question.    ",1592,1011,,
potter.pdf,en,128,"Ron, at the next table, wasn’t having much more luck.  ‘Wingardium Leviosa!’ he shouted, waving his long arms like a  windmill.  ‘You’re saying it wrong,’ Harry heard Hermione snap. ‘It’s Wing- gar-dium Levi-o-sa, make the “gar” nice and long.’  ‘You do it, then, if you’re so clever,’ Ron snarled.  Hermione rolled up the sleeves of her gown, flicked her wand  and said, ‘Wingardium Leviosa!’  Their feather rose off the desk and hovered about four feet  above their heads.  ‘Oh, well done!’ cried Professor Flitwick, clapping. ‘Everyone  see here, Miss Granger’s done it!’  Ron was in a very bad temper by the end of the class.  ‘It’s no wonder no one can stand her,’ he said to Harry as they  pushed their way into the crowded corridor. ‘She’s a nightmare,  honestly.’  Someone knocked into Harry as they hurried past him. It was  Hermione. Harry caught a glimpse of her face – and was startled   to see that she was in tears.  ‘I think she heard you.’  ‘So?’ said Ron, but he looked a bit uncomfortable. ‘She must’ve  noticed she’s got no friends.’  Hermione didn’t turn up for the next class and wasn’t seen all  afternoon. On their way down to the Great Hall for the   Hallowe’en feast, Harry and Ron overheard Parvati Patil telling   her friend Lavender that Hermione was crying in the girls’ toilets  and wanted to be left alone. Ron looked still more awkward at   this, but a moment later they had entered the Great Hall, where  the Hallowe’en decorations put Hermione out of their minds.  A thousand live bats fluttered from the walls and ceiling while   a thousand more swooped over the tables in low black clouds,  making the candles in the pumpkins stutter. The feast appeared  suddenly on the golden plates, as it had at the start-of-term  banquet.  Harry was just helping himself to a jacket potato when  Professor Quirrell came sprinting into the Hall, his turban askew  and terror on his face. Everyone stared as he reached Professor  Dumbledore’s chair, slumped against the table and gasped, ‘Troll –  in the dungeons – thought you ought to know.’  He then sank to the floor in a dead faint.  ",2111,1148,,
potter.pdf,en,28,"Harry lay in his dark cupboard much later, wishing he had a watch.  He didn’t know what time it was and he couldn’t be sure the  Dursleys were asleep yet. Until they were, he couldn’t risk sneaking  to the kitchen for some food.  He’d lived with the Dursleys almost ten years, ten miserable  years, as long as he could remember, ever since he’d been a baby  and his parents had died in that car crash. He couldn’t remember  being in the car when his parents had died. Sometimes, when he  strained his memory during long hours in his cupboard, he came  up with a strange vision: a blinding flash of green light and a  burning pain on his forehead. This, he supposed, was the crash,  though he couldn’t imagine where all the green light came from.  He couldn’t remember his parents at all. His aunt and uncle never  spoke about them, and of course he was forbidden to ask  questions. There were no photographs of them in the house.  When he had been younger, Harry had dreamed and dreamed  of some unknown relation coming to take him away, but it had  never happened; the Dursleys were his only family. Yet sometimes  he thought (or maybe hoped) that strangers in the street seemed   to know him. Very strange strangers they were, too. A tiny man in  a violet top hat had bowed to him once while out shopping with  Aunt Petunia and Dudley. After asking Harry furiously if he knew  the man, Aunt Petunia had rushed them out of the shop without  buying anything. A wild-looking old woman dressed all in green  had waved merrily at him once on a bus. A bald man in a very   long purple coat had actually shaken his hand in the street the  other day and then walked away without a word. The weirdest  thing about all these people was the way they seemed to vanish   the second Harry tried to get a closer look.  At school, Harry had no one. Everybody knew that Dudley’s  gang hated that odd Harry Potter in his baggy old clothes and  broken glasses, and nobody liked to disagree with Dudley’s gang.    ",1996,1084,,
potter.pdf,en,51,"‘Give him five Knuts,’ said Hagrid sleepily.  ‘Knuts?’  ‘The little bronze ones.’  Harry counted out five little bronze coins and the owl held out  its leg so he could put the money into a small leather pouch tied   to it. Then it flew off through the open window.  Hagrid yawned loudly, sat up and stretched.  ‘Best be off, Harry, lots ter do today, gotta get up ter London an’  buy all yer stuff fer school.’  Harry was turning over the wizard coins and looking at them.  He had just thought of something which made him feel as though  the happy balloon inside him had got a puncture.  ‘Um – Hagrid?’  ‘Mm?’ said Hagrid, who was pulling on his huge boots.  ‘I haven’t got any money – and you heard Uncle Vernon last  night – he won’t pay for me to go and learn magic.’  ‘Don’t worry about that,’ said Hagrid, standing up and scratch- ing his head. ‘D’yeh think yer parents didn’t leave yeh anything?’  ‘But if their house was destroyed –’  ‘They didn’ keep their gold in the house, boy! Nah, first stop   fer us is Gringotts. Wizards’ bank. Have a sausage, they’re not bad  cold – an’ I wouldn’ say no teh a bit o’ yer birthday cake, neither.’  ‘Wizards have banks?’  ‘Just the one. Gringotts. Run by goblins.’  Harry dropped the bit of sausage he was holding.  ‘Goblins?’  ‘Yeah – so yeh’d be mad ter try an’ rob it, I’ll tell yeh that. Never  mess with goblins, Harry. Gringotts is the safest place in the world  fer anything yeh want ter keep safe – ’cept maybe Hogwarts. As a  matter o’ fact, I gotta visit Gringotts anyway. Fer Dumbledore.  Hogwarts business.’ Hagrid drew himself up proudly. ‘He usually  gets me ter do important stuff fer him. Fetchin’ you – gettin’   things from Gringotts – knows he can trust me, see.  ‘Got everythin’? Come on, then.’  Harry followed Hagrid out on to the rock. The sky was quite  clear now and the sea gleamed in the sunlight. The boat Uncle  Vernon had hired was still there, with a lot of water in the bottom  after the storm.  ‘How did you get here?’ Harry asked, looking around for  another boat.  ",2048,1168,,
potter.pdf,en,105,"‘You – Potter – why didn’t you tell him not to add the quills?  Thought he’d make you look good if he got it wrong, did you?  That’s another point you’ve lost for Gryffindor.’  This was so unfair that Harry opened his mouth to argue, but  Ron kicked him behind their cauldron.  ‘Don’t push it,’ he muttered. ‘I’ve heard Snape can turn very  nasty.’  As they climbed the steps out of the dungeon an hour later,  Harry’s mind was racing and his spirits were low. He’d lost two  points for Gryffindor in his very first week – why did Snape hate  him so much?  ‘Cheer up,’ said Ron. ‘Snape’s always taking points off Fred and  George. Can I come and meet Hagrid with you?’  At five to three they left the castle and made their way across  the grounds. Hagrid lived in a small wooden house on the edge of  the Forbidden Forest. A crossbow and a pair of galoshes were out- side the front door.  When Harry knocked they heard a frantic scrabbling from  inside and several booming barks. Then Hagrid’s voice rang out,  saying, ‘Back, Fang – back.’  Hagrid’s big hairy face appeared in the crack as he pulled the  door open.  ‘Hang on,’ he said. ‘Back, Fang.’  He let them in, struggling to keep a hold on the collar of an  enormous black boarhound.  There was only one room inside. Hams and pheasants were  hanging from the ceiling, a copper kettle was boiling on the open  fire and in a corner stood a massive bed with a patchwork quilt  over it.  ‘Make yerselves at home,’ said Hagrid, letting go of Fang, who  bounded straight at Ron and started licking his ears. Like Hagrid,  Fang was clearly not as fierce as he looked.  ‘This is Ron,’ Harry told Hagrid, who was pouring boiling water  into a large teapot and putting rock cakes on to a plate.  ‘Another Weasley, eh?’ said Hagrid, glancing at Ron’s freckles. ‘I  spent half me life chasin’ yer twin brothers away from the Forest.’  The rock cakes almost broke their teeth, but Harry and Ron  pretended to be enjoying them as they told Hagrid all about their  first lessons. Fang rested his head on Harry’s knee and drooled all  over his robes.  ",2093,1158,,
potter.pdf,en,196,"‘Look,’ said Harry, throwing caution to the winds, ‘Professor – it’s  about the Philosopher’s Stone –’  Whatever Professor McGonagall had expected, it wasn’t that.  The books she was carrying tumbled out of her arms but she didn’t  pick them up.  ‘How do you know –?’ she spluttered.  ‘Professor, I think – I know – that Sn– that someone’s going to try  and steal the Stone. I’ve got to talk to Professor Dumbledore.’  She eyed him with a mixture of shock and suspicion.  ‘Professor Dumbledore will be back tomorrow,’ she said finally. ‘I  don’t know how you found out about the Stone, but rest assured,  no one can possibly steal it, it’s too well protected.’  ‘But Professor –’  ‘Potter, I know what I’m talking about,’ she said shortly. She bent  down and gathered up the fallen books. ‘I suggest you all go back  outside and enjoy the sunshine.’  But they didn’t.  ‘It’s tonight,’ said Harry, once he was sure Professor McGonagall  was out of earshot. ‘Snape’s going through the trapdoor tonight.  He’s found out everything he needs and now he’s got Dumbledore  out of the way. He sent that note, I bet the Ministry of Magic will  get a real shock when Dumbledore turns up.’  ‘But what can we –’  Hermione gasped. Harry and Ron wheeled round.  Snape was standing there.  ‘Good afternoon,’ he said smoothly.  They stared at him.  ‘You shouldn’t be inside on a day like this,’ he said, with an odd,  twisted smile.  ‘We were –’ Harry began, without any idea what he was going to  say.  ‘You want to be more careful,’ said Snape. ‘Hanging around like  this, people will think you’re up to something. And Gryffindor really  can’t afford to lose any more points, can they?’  Harry flushed. They turned to go back outside, but Snape called  them back.  ‘Be warned, Potter – any more night-time wanderings and I will  personally make sure you are expelled. Good day to you.’  He strode off in the direction of the staff room.  Out on the stone steps, Harry turned to the others.  ",1977,1126,,
potter.pdf,en,177,"Wandering around in the middle of the night, how dare you –’  ‘You don’t understand, Professor, Harry Potter’s coming – he’s  got a dragon!’  ‘What utter rubbish! How dare you tell such lies! Come on – I  shall see Professor Snape about you, Malfoy!’  The steep spiral staircase up to the top of the tower seemed the  easiest thing in the world after that. Not until they’d stepped out  into the cold night air did they throw off the Cloak, glad to be   able to breathe properly again. Hermione did a sort of jig.  ‘Malfoy’s got detention! I could sing!’  ‘Don’t,’ Harry advised her.  Chuckling about Malfoy, they waited, Norbert thrashing about  in his crate. About ten minutes later, four broomsticks came  swooping down out of the darkness.  Charlie’s friends were a cheery lot. They showed Harry and  Hermione the harness they’d rigged up, so they could suspend  Norbert between them. They all helped buckle Norbert safely into  it and then Harry and Hermione shook hands with the others and  thanked them very much.  At last, Norbert was going … going … gone.  They slipped back down the spiral staircase, their hearts as  light as their hands, now that Norbert was off them. No more  dragon – Malfoy in detention – what could spoil their happiness?  The answer to that was waiting at the foot of the stairs. As they  stepped into the corridor, Filch’s face loomed suddenly out of the  darkness.  ‘Well, well, well,’ he whispered, ‘we are in trouble.’  They’d left the Invisibility Cloak on top of the tower.

potter.pdf,en,60,"They went rattling over an underground ravine and Harry leant  over the side to try and see what was down at the dark bottom but  Hagrid groaned and pulled him back by the scruff of his neck.  Vault seven hundred and thirteen had no keyhole.  ‘Stand back,’ said Griphook importantly. He stroked the door  gently with one of his long fingers and it simply melted away.  ‘If anyone but a Gringotts goblin tried that, they’d be sucked  through the door and trapped in there,’ said Griphook.  ‘How often do you check to see if anyone’s inside?’ Harry asked.  ‘About once every ten years,’ said Griphook, with a rather nasty  grin.  Something really extraordinary had to be inside this top- security vault, Harry was sure, and he leant forward eagerly,  expecting to see fabulous jewels at the very least – but at first he  thought it was empty. Then he noticed a grubby little package  wrapped up in brown paper lying on the floor. Hagrid picked it   up and tucked it deep inside his coat. Harry longed to know what  it was, but knew better than to ask.  ‘Come on, back in this infernal cart, and don’t talk to me on the  way back, it’s best if I keep me mouth shut,’ said Hagrid.  *  One wild cart-ride later they stood blinking in the sunlight out- side Gringotts. Harry didn’t know where to run first now that he  had a bag full of money. He didn’t have to know how many  Galleons there were to a pound to know that he was holding more  money than he’d had in his whole life – more money than even  Dudley had ever had.  ‘Might as well get yer uniform,’ said Hagrid, nodding towards  Madam Malkin’s Robes for All Occasions. ‘Listen, Harry, would yeh  mind if I slipped off fer a pick-me-up in the Leaky Cauldron? I  hate them Gringotts carts.’ He did still look a bit sick, so Harry  entered Madam Malkin’s shop alone, feeling nervous.  Madam Malkin was a squat, smiling witch dressed all in mauve.  ‘Hogwarts, dear?’ she said, when Harry started to speak. ‘Got  the lot here – another young man being fitted up just now, in fact.’  In the back of the shop, a boy with a pale, pointed face was  standing on a footstool while a second witch pinned up his long  black robes. Madam Malkin stood Harry on a stool next to him,  slipped a long robe over his head and began to pin it to the right  length.  ",2299,1208,,
potter.pdf,en,69,"Grunt. Harry supposed that meant yes.  ‘Thank you.’  He was about to go back upstairs when Uncle Vernon actually  spoke.  ‘Funny way to get to a wizards’ school, the train. Magic carpets  all got punctures, have they?’  Harry didn’t say anything.  ‘Where is this school, anyway?’  ‘I don’t know,’ said Harry, realising this for the first time. He  pulled the ticket Hagrid had given him out of his pocket.  ‘I just take the train from platform nine and three-quarters at  eleven o’clock,’ he read.  His aunt and uncle stared.  ‘Platform what?’  ‘Nine and three-quarters.’  ‘Don’t talk rubbish,’ said Uncle Vernon, ‘there is no platform  nine and three-quarters.’  ‘It’s on my ticket.’  ‘Barking,’ said Uncle Vernon, ‘howling mad, the lot of them.  You’ll see. You just wait. All right, we’ll take you to King’s Cross.  We’re going up to London tomorrow anyway, or I wouldn’t bother.’  ‘Why are you going to London?’ Harry asked, trying to keep  things friendly.  ‘Taking Dudley to hospital,’ growled Uncle Vernon. ‘Got to  have that ruddy tail removed before he goes to Smeltings.’  *  Harry woke at five o’clock the next morning and was too excited  and nervous to go back to sleep. He got up and pulled on his   jeans because he didn’t want to walk into the station in his wiz- ard’s robes – he’d change on the train. He checked his Hogwarts  list yet again to make sure he had everything he needed, saw that  Hedwig was shut safely in her cage and then paced the room,  waiting for the Dursleys to get up. Two hours later, Harry’s huge,  heavy trunk had been loaded into the Dursleys’ car, Aunt Petunia  had talked Dudley into sitting next to Harry and they had set off.  They reached King’s Cross at half past ten. Uncle Vernon  dumped Harry’s trunk on to a trolley and wheeled it into the sta- tion for him. Harry thought this was strangely kind until Uncle  Vernon stopped dead, facing the platforms with a nasty grin on   his face.  ",1940,1110,,
psych.pdf,en,252,"In advance of the experiment,  Milgram had asked several different  groups of people, including ordinary  members of the public as well as  psychologists and psychiatrists,  how far they thought participants  would go when asked to administer  the electric shocks. Most people  thought participants would stop at  a level that caused pain, and the  psychiatrists predicted that, at most,  one in 1,000 would continue to the  highest level of shock. Astonishingly,  when the experiment took place,  Milgram found that all 40 of the  participants obeyed commands to  administer shocks up to 300 volts.  Only ﬁve people refused to continue  at this point; 65 percent of the  participants obeyed the instructions  of the “scientist” right to the end,  obeying commands to administer  shocks to the top level of 450 volts.  Their discomfort at doing so  was often evident: many showed  signs of severe distress, tension,  and nervousness over the course   of the experiment. They stuttered,  trembled, sweated, groaned, broke  out into nervous laughing ﬁts, and  three people had full-blown seizures.  In every instance of the experiment,  the participant stopped and  questioned it at some point; some  even offered to refund the money  they were paid at the beginning.  Interviews after the experiments  conﬁrmed that, with only a few  exceptions, participants had been  completely convinced that the  “learning experiment” was real.  All participants were fully  debriefed so they understood what  had actually taken place, and they  were asked a series of questions to  test that they were not emotionally  harmed by the experience. The  participants were also reunited with  the “learner” (Mr. Wallace) so that  they could see that no actual  shocks had been administered.  ",1774,1020,,
psych.pdf,en,252,"Feeling obliged to obey Milgram noted several features   of the experiment that may have  contributed to such high levels of  obedience; for example, the fact  that it took place at the prestigious  Yale University gave it credibility.  In addition, participants believed  that the study was designed to  advance knowledge, and they had  been assured that the shocks were  painful but not dangerous. Being  paid may have increased their  sense of obligation, as did the fact  they had volunteered to take part.  To test these explanations, Milgram  ran many variations on the study,  but changing the context had only  minor effects on the results.  Milgram wanted to see if the  inclination to obey authority ﬁgures  can become the major factor in  determining behavior, even in  extreme circumstances. It is clear  from the reactions and responses   of the participants that obeying the  “scientist” was violating their own  sense of morality and negatively  affecting them both physically and  emotionally, but the pressure to  comply was simply too powerful   to defy in most cases.  This sense of obedience,  Milgram felt, comes from the fact  that people are socialized from a  very young age (by parents and ❯❯ By the 1960s, Yale University was  known to the general public as being  highly prestigious; its authority may  have seemed literally unquestionable  to the participants of Milgram’s study.

psych.pdf,en,38,"Cultural psychology For Wundt, the psychological  development of a person is  determined not only by sensations  but also by complex social and  cultural inﬂuences, which cannot  be replicated or controlled in an  experimental situation. He included  religion, language, myths, history,  art, laws, and customs among  these inﬂuences, discussing them  in a ten-volume work, Cultural  Psychology, which he wrote during  the last 20 years of his life. Wundt saw language as an  especially important part of culture’s  contribution to consciousness. Any  verbal communication begins with  a “general impression,” or uniﬁed  idea of something we wish to say.  Having “apperceived” this general  starting point, we then choose  words and sentences to express it.  While speaking, we monitor the  accuracy of the intended meaning.  We might say, “No, that’s not right, I  mean…,” and then choose a different  word or phrase to express ourselves  better. Whoever is listening has to  understand the meaning that the  speaker is trying to convey, but   the actual words may not be as  important as the general impression,  especially if strong emotions are  involved. As evidence of the fact that  we use this process, Wundt points  out that we often remember the  general meaning of what a person  has said long after we’ve forgotten  the speciﬁc words that were used.

He went on to  study at the universities of Berlin,  Tübingen, and Heidelberg,  graduating in medicine in 1856.  Two years later, Wundt became  assistant to the physician Hermann  von Helmholtz, who was famous  for his work on visual perception.  While at Heidelberg, Wundt  started teaching the world’s ﬁrst  course in experimental  psychology, and in 1879 opened  the ﬁrst psychology laboratory.

He noted  that facial expressions linked to  these emotions are involuntary— we react automatically to things  that trigger these emotional  responses—and that this reaction  often happens before our conscious  mind has time to register the  causes of that emotion. Ekman  inferred not only that our faces can  reveal our inner emotional state,  but that the emotions responsible  for these involuntary expressions are  more powerful than psychologists  had previously thought. In Emotions Revealed, Ekman  states that emotions can be more  powerful than the Freudian drives  of sex, hunger, and even the will to  live.

It was in this that his  views proved to be most publicly  inﬂuential, and eventually most  controversial. Predictably, he  advocated a strictly behaviorist  approach to bringing up children,  and throughout the 1920s and 30s  his many books on childcare became  immensely popular. In retrospect,   Watsonism has become   gospel and catechism in the  nurseries and drawing   rooms of America. Mortimer Adler it is easy to see that his approach,  based on extreme emotional  detachment, was at best misguided  and potentially damaging, but his  methods were adopted by millions   of parents, including Watson and  Rosalie Rayner themselves.  The child, Watson believed, is  shaped by its environment, and  that environment is controlled by  the parents. In essence, he saw  child-raising as an objective exercise  in behavior modiﬁcation, especially  of the emotions of fear, rage, and  love. Perhaps understandably, given  his own unhappy childhood, he  dismissed affection as sentimental,  leading to over-dependence of the  child on the parent. But he also  advised against the opposite  emotional extreme and was an  opponent of physical punishment. Watson’s questionable application  of stimulus–response conditioning  to childcare eventually drew  criticism. Later generations viewed  the approach as manipulative and  uncaring, with an emphasis on  efﬁciency and results rather than   on the wellbeing of the child.

George Armitage Miller  took this idea of channel capacity   a stage further, applying it to the  model of short-term memory.  William James ﬁrst proposed the  notion of short-term memory, and   it had long been an accepted part  of the model of the brain as an  information processor, coming  between the sensory input of  information and long-term memory.  Hermann Ebbinghaus and Wilhelm  Wundt had even suggested that  short-term memory had a capacity  limited to around seven items  (seven, again).

The  multidimensional stimuli of  previous experiments could be  seen as composed of several “bits”  of related information, but treated  as a single item.

A chunk is not,  however, just an arbitrary grouping,  but an encoding of bits into a  meaningful unit; for example, a  string of 21 letters represents 21  bits of information, but if this can  be broken down into a sequence   of three-letter words, it becomes  seven chunks.

psych.pdf,en,88,"Unlearning fear  Wolpe believed that there must be  a simpler and quicker way than  psychoanalysis to address the  problem of deep anxiety. He was  aware of the work of behaviorists  such as Ivan Pavlov and John  Watson, who had successfully  taught animals and children new  behavioral patterns through  stimulus-response training, or  classical conditioning. They had  been able to make a previously  unfelt emotional response to an  object or event become automatic.  Wolpe reasoned that if behavior  could be learned in this way,   it could also be unlearned, and he  proposed to ﬁnd a method of using  this to help disturbed war veterans. Wolpe had discovered that a  human being is not capable of  experiencing two contradictory  states of emotion at the same time.  It is not possible, for example, to  feel great anxiety of any kind, when  you are feeling very relaxed. This  inspired him to teach his patients  deep-muscle relaxation techniques,  which he went on to pair with  simultaneous exposure to   some form of anxiety-inducing  stimuli—a technique that became  known as reciprocal inhibition.  Wolpe’s patients were asked   to imagine the thing or event that  they found disturbing. If they  started to become anxious, they  would be encouraged to “stop  imagining the scene and relax.”  This approach gradually blocked  out a patient’s feelings of fear. Just  as the patient had previously been  conditioned by his experiences to  become anxious when recalling  certain particularly harrowing  memories, he now became  conditioned—within a very short  time—to block out his anxiety  response, by focusing on the  directly contradictory feeling of  being totally relaxed.

One critical tool patients are given  for increasing self-awareness is the  instruction to notice and change the  use of the word “I” within speech.  Perls says that to take responsibility  for our reality, we must recognize  how we use language to give the  illusion that we have no control  when this is not the case. By simply  rephrasing “I can’t do that” to “I  won’t do that,” it becomes clear that  I am making a choice. This also  helps to establish ownership of  feeling; emotions arise in and belong  to me; I cannot blame someone or  something else for my feelings.  Other examples of language  change include replacing the word  “should” with “want,” changing, for  example, ”I should leave now” to “I  want to leave now.” This also acts  to reveal the element of choice.

These beliefs are the  foundation of an approach that  regards patients in an entirely  positive light, one of absolute,  unconditional acceptance. Rogers  asked that his patients learn to do  the same for themselves and for  others. This perspective, grounded  in compassion and the recognition  of the potential of each and every  individual, is famously termed  “unconditional positive regard.”  Rogers believed that all people,   not just his patients, needed to be  able to view themselves in this  way, as well as those around them   and their environment.  Unconditional self-acceptance  and unconditional acceptance of  others are vital, and when these   are lacking, people fail to remain  open to experience.

Much of modern personality  testing derives from the work of  Raymond Cattell and Hans Eysenck,  and both of these psychologists  drew upon Allport’s lexical study.  Cattell’s “16 Personality Factor  Questionnaire,” which is still used  by psychologists today, uses 16  traits identiﬁed by Cattell through  computer analysis of Allport and  Odbert’s original 4,500 adjectives. Humanistic psychology, which  forms the basis of most counseling  and therapeutic practices, also  relies heavily upon Allport’s ideas,  particularly his idiographic method  and insistence upon the uniqueness  of each and every person. Increased  focus on the practitioner–client  relationship as a vehicle for the  expression and development of  personality has its roots in Allport’s  assertion that personality is largely  a function of relationships. Allport was also one of the   ﬁrst to point out that even those  psychological theories that attempt  to explore positive human experience  are based “largely upon the behavior  of sick and anxious people or upon  the antics of captive and desperate  rats.” He wondered why there were  no theories based on the study of  healthy human beings, and those  who strive to make life worth   living. He pointed out that most  studies are of criminals, not of   law abiders; of fear, not courage;  and focus on the blindness of  humans, rather than their vision.  The burgeoning school of positive  psychology, led by Martin  Seligman, has taken up this idea  and aims to develop a scientiﬁc  psychology of positive  experience. By 1955, when Allport wrote  Becoming, his thinking had  developed further; he now saw  human striving toward a higher level  of consciousness and realization as  the true motive of personality. The  idea that “becoming” is the ultimate  goal of human beings was also  developed by the psychologists   Carl Rogers and then Abraham  Maslow, who renamed it “self- actualization.” Although Allport’s  work is cited less often than other  well-known ﬁgures, he had a  profound and lasting inﬂuence   on the ﬁeld of psychology. ■  Gordon Willard Allport was  born in Montezuma, Indiana   in 1897.

psych.pdf,en,297,"Universal grammar  But where is the proof that language  acquisition is inborn rather than  learned? According to Chomsky,  the most convincing evidence for  this claim is that there are aspects  of grammar that are so intuitive  and self-evident that they need  never be discussed or learned in  order to be understood (they are  therefore part of our biological  inheritance). For instance, there   are certain constructions in the  English language that permit the  dropping of pronouns, and others  that do not. The difference between  the two is subtle, yet even by the  age of six, native English-speaking  children will use the constructions  ﬂawlessly. This implies that certain  aspects of grammar are understood  without requiring any instruction,  and that the knowledge is therefore  innate. This is the only way to  explain how people have such a  rich grammatical understanding  and how children can use language  so creatively by the age of six.  Chomsky claims that “universal  grammar” is found worldwide, with  modiﬁcations according to people’s  native languages. It is a predeﬁned  mechanism that acts as the basis  for the acquisition of any language.  He argues that this is demonstrated  by the way that all children are  equally able to learn any language  to which they are exposed. He says  that a common set of linguistic  features is built into the language  organ through heredity, and it  includes elements of grammar,  meaning, and speech.

In his opinion, the most basic  intelligence is characterized by  simple stimulus and response  association, resulting in a neural  connection. The more intelligent   an animal, the more capable it will  be of making such connections.  Therefore, intelligence can be  deﬁned in terms of the ability to  form neural bonds, which is  dependent not only on genetic  factors, but also on experience.  To ﬁnd a measurement of  human intelligence, Thorndike  devised his CAVD (Completion,  Arithmetic, Vocabulary, and  Directions) test. It became the  model for all modern intelligence  tests, and assessed mechanical  intelligence (understanding of how  things work), as well as abstract  intelligence (creative ability) and  social intelligence (interpersonal  skills). Thorndike was especially  interested in how age might affect  learning, and also proposed a  theory of learning that remains at  the heart of educational psychology  to this day, a contribution that is  perhaps what Thorndike would  have wished more than anything  else to be remembered for. However,  it is for his enormous inﬂuence on  the behaviorist movement that  Thorndike is most often lauded. ■ The son of a Methodist  minister, Edward Thorndike  was born in Williamsburg,  Massachusetts, USA, in 1874.  He graduated in sciences from  Wesleyan University in 1895,  proceeding to Harvard to  study psychology under  William James. In 1897,  Thorndike moved to Columbia  University in New York City,  where he completed his  doctorate thesis in 1898.   Thorndike’s interest in  educational psychology led   to a teaching post at the  College for Women of Case  Western Reserve in Cleveland,  Ohio, but he returned to  Columbia just a year later, in  1899, teaching there until his  retirement in 1939. In 1912, his  peers elected him President   of the American Psychological  Association. Thorndike  continued to research and  write until his death, aged 74,  in Montrose, New York.  ",2080,1098,,

Kuo felt that instinct was just   a convenient way for psychologists  to explain behavior that did not   ﬁt current theory: “Our behavior  researches in the past have been   in the wrong direction, because,  instead of ﬁnding how we could  build nature into the animal, we  have tried to ﬁnd nature in the  animal.” Kuo’s most well-known  experiments involved rearing  kittens—some raised from birth in  cages with rats, others introduced  to rats at later stages. He found that  “if a kitten was raised in the same  cage with a rat since it was very  young, it, when grown-up, became  tolerant of rats: not only would it  never attack a rat, but it adopted  the rat as its ‘mate’, played with it,  and even became attached to it.”  Kuo’s work was cut short by political  events in China, which forced him  to ﬂee ﬁrst to the US, then Hong  Kong. His ideas only became known  in the West as behaviorism was  beginning to wane and cognitive  psychology was in the ascendant.

psych.pdf,en,14,"An inﬂuential science The many branches of psychology  that exist today cover the whole  spectrum of mental life and human  and animal behavior. The overall  scope has extended to overlap with  many other disciplines, including  medicine, physiology, neuroscience,  computer science, education,  sociology, anthropology, and even  politics, economics, and the law.  Psychology has become perhaps  the most diverse of sciences.  Psychology continues to  inﬂuence and be inﬂuenced by the  other sciences, especially in areas  such as neuroscience and genetics.   In particular, the nature versus  nurture argument that dates back  to Francis Galton’s ideas of the  1920s continues to this day;  recently, evolutionary psychology  has contributed to the debate by  exploring psychological traits as  innate and biological phenomena,  which are subject to the laws of  genetics and natural selection. Psychology is a huge subject,  and its ﬁndings concern every one  of us. In one form or another it  informs many decisions made in  government, business and industry,  advertising, and the mass media.   It affects us as groups and as  individuals, contributing as much  to public debate about the ways our  societies are or might be structured  as it does to diagnosing and  treating mental disorders.  The ideas and theories of  psychologists have become part of  our everyday culture, to the extent  that many of their ﬁndings about  behavior and mental processes are  now viewed simply as “common  sense.” However, while some of the  ideas explored in psychology  conﬁrm our instinctive feelings,  just as many make us think again;  psychologists have often shocked  and outraged the public when their  ﬁndings have shaken conventional,  long-standing beliefs. In its short history, psychology  has given us many ideas that have  changed our ways of thinking,   and that have also helped us to  understand ourselves, other people,  and the world we live in. It has  questioned deeply held beliefs,  unearthed unsettling truths, and  provided startling insights and  solutions to complex questions.   Its increasing popularity as a  university course is a sign not   only of psychology’s relevance in  the modern world, but also of the  enjoyment and stimulation that can  be had from exploring the richness  and diversity of a subject that  continues to examine the mysterious  world of the human mind.

One of the ﬁrst to be discussed   by Freud at length was dream  analysis; he famously studied   his own dreams in his book, The  Interpretation of Dreams. He  claimed that every dream enacts   a wish fulﬁlment, and the more  unpalatable the wish is to our  conscious mind, the more hidden   or distorted the desire becomes in  our dreams. So the unconscious,   he says, sends messages to our  conscious mind in code. For  instance, Freud discusses dreams  where the dreamer is naked—the  primary source for these dreams in  most people is memories from early  childhood, when nakedness was  not frowned upon and there was   no sense of shame. In dreams  where the dreamer feels  embarrassment, the other people   in the dream generally seem  oblivious, lending support to a  wish-fulﬁlment interpretation  where the dreamer wants to leave  behind shame and restriction.

As he wrote in  Psychological Automatism: “To  have one’s body in the posture of  terror is to feel the emotion of terror;  and if this posture is determined by  a subconscious idea, the patient  will have the emotion alone in his  consciousness without knowing  why he feels this way.” As her terror  took hold, Lucie would say, “I'm  afraid and I don't know why.” “The  unconscious,” said Janet, “is having  its dream; it sees the men behind  the curtains, and puts the body in a  posture of terror.” Janet added that  he believed traumatic events and  stress could cause dissociation in  anyone with that predisposition. Janet described the part of the  mind that he believed was behind  uncharacteristic and disturbed  behavior as “the subconscious.” But  Sigmund Freud thought this term  was too vague, and instead labeled  the source of his patients' mental  traumas as the “unconscious.” Freud  also developed Janet's ideas,  stating that dissociation was a  universal “defense mechanism.”  Janet’s work was neglected for  decades, as the use of hypnotism to  investigate and treat mental illness  was discredited. However, since  the late 20th century, it has again  attracted interest from psychologists  studying dissociative disorders. ■ Pierre Janet Pierre Janet was born into a  cultured, middle-class family in  Paris, France.

The publication of his  ﬁndings in the 1970s coincided  with a new determination by many  cognitive psychologists to ﬁnd  conﬁrmation of their theories in  neuroscience, using brain-imaging  techniques that had just become  available. In conjunction with  neuroscientists, Tulving was able  to map the areas of the brain that  are active during encoding and  retrieval of memory, and establish  that episodic memory is associated  with the medial temporal lobe and,  speciﬁcally, the hippocampus.  Partly due to his unorthodox  and untutored approach, Tulving  made innovative insights that  proved inspirational to other  psychologists, including some of  his former students such as Daniel  Schacter. Tulving’s focus on storage  and retrieval provided a new way of  thinking about memory, but it was  perhaps his distinction between  semantic and episodic memory that  was his breakthrough contribution.  It allowed subsequent psychologists  to increase the complexity of the  model to include such concepts as  procedural memory (remembering  how to do something), and the  difference between explicit memory  (of which we are consciously aware)  and implicit memory (of which we  have no conscious awareness,   but which nonetheless continues   to affect us).

psych.pdf,en,298,"Evaluation Cognitive scientist Steven Pinker  agrees that language is an instinct  stemming from an innate program  that is hard-wired in the human  brain, but says that it arose through  evolution and was therefore  adaptive, helping our ancestors to  survive. Chomsky disagrees with  Pinker about how language  evolved, arguing that language  represents a distinct mental module  that is unique to human beings and  completely independent of general  cognitive ability.  Linguist Jean Aitchison is also  in agreement with Chomsky’s  claim that children are hard-wired  with knowledge of linguistic rules,  but her view is that children have  built-in problem-solving abilities  that enable them to process  linguistic data (and other forms   of data). Chomsky maintains,  however, that human beings’  innate language ability exists  independently of other abilities, and  because the mind is constructed of  mental organs similar to those of  the body, language can easily be  isolated from other mental faculties.  Criticism also comes from   Robin Chapman, an expert in  communicative disorders, who  argues that the study of language  development should also be  understood within the context of  children’s social interactions. She  notes that language structure is  acquired piecemeal over several  years, and that there are wide  variations in how rapidly children  acquire it, suggesting that social  environment could also be a factor.  There is also some degree of doubt  surrounding Chomsky’s assumption  that language is unique to human  beings. Data from studies with  chimpanzees and gorillas has  suggested that the difference  between ape and human language is  quantitative rather than qualitative,  which raises questions about how  species-speciﬁc language really is.

psych.pdf,en,142,"An existential approach May viewed life as a spectrum   of human experience, including  suffering as a normal part of life,  not as a sign of pathology. It is   self-evident that as human beings,  we tend to seek experiences that  allow us to be comfortable. We  enjoy our familiar environments,  and favor experiences that keep   the mental and physical senses   in a state of balance and ease.   This tendency, however, leads   us to judge and label experiences  as “good” or “bad,” depending   only on the levels of pleasure or  discomfort they may bring. May  says that in doing so, we do  ourselves a disservice, since we   are ﬁghting against processes that   lead to immense growth and  development if we can accept   them as a natural part of life. May proposes an approach to  life that echoes Buddhist thought,  where we accept all forms of  experience equally, rather than  shunning or denying those we  judge to be uncomfortable or  unpleasant. We also need to accept  our “negative” feelings, rather than  avoid or repress them. Suffering  and sadness are not pathological  issues to be “ﬁxed,” he says; they  are natural and essential parts of  living a human life, and are also  important because they lead   to psychological growth. ■ BEFORE 1841 Søren Kierkegaard  claims that people misinterpret  Christian ideology and misuse  science to falsely defend  against the anxiety inherent   in existence.

psych.pdf,en,311,"Cardinal traits  Based on a further analysis of   his lexical study, Allport deﬁned   three distinct categories of traits:  cardinal, common, and secondary.  Cardinal traits are those that are  fundamental to a person, governing  their entire approach to life. Not  everyone has a cardinal trait,  according to Allport, but when they  do, they may even be famous for  them; in fact some people are so  famous for them that their name  becomes a byword for that trait,  giving us terms such as Byronic,  Calvinistic, and Machiavellian.   On a less iconic scale, a person’s  cardinal trait might be something  like “a fear of communism,” where  this is so central and important to  someone that it guides and uniﬁes  their life in both conscious and  unconscious ways; virtually every  act is traceable to its inﬂuence.  In his later years, Allport  considered a person’s cardinal  traits as contributing to the  proprium: the essential drives, core  needs, and desires of a person. This  concept goes beyond the idea of  temperament, and is more akin to a  guiding purpose that will always  press for expression. As an example  of the proprium, Allport gave the  Norwegian polar explorer Roald  Amundsen, who had one dominant  passion from the age of 15: he  wanted to be a polar explorer. The  obstacles to his ambition seemed  insurmountable, and the temptation  to relinquish his dreams was great,  but the “propriate” striving persisted,  and though he welcomed each  success, it simply raised his level   of aspiration. Having sailed the  Northwest Passage, Amundsen  embarked upon the project that led  to his success in reaching the South  Pole. Then, after years of planning  and discouragement, he ﬂew over  the North Pole. His commitment  never wavered, and he eventually  died attempting to save the life of a  less experienced explorer.

They are shared among  many people within a culture but in  varying degrees; aggressiveness,  for instance, is a common trait   that varies by degrees. According  In 1936, Allport and his colleague  H.S.

This causes them to  weaken over time, so that they  eventually sink below the “threshold  of consciousness.” Should two ideas  directly contradict one another,  “resistance occurs” and “concepts  become forces when they resist one  another.” They repel one another  with an energy that propels one of  them beyond consciousness, into   a place that Herbart referred to as   “a state of tendency;” and we now  know as “the unconscious.”  Herbart saw the unconscious   as simply a kind of storage place for  weak or opposed ideas.

psych.pdf,en,306,"Measuring creativity By deﬁnition, creativity means there  is more than one answer to any  problem. It requires a different kind  of thinking, which Guilford calls  “divergent,” since it goes in different  directions and produces multiple  solutions to a problem. In contrast,  traditional IQ tests require thinking  that ends up with a single answer:  “convergent” thinking.  Guilford thought that creativity  was measurable—it is indicated by  the number of directions in which a  person’s thoughts travel. He devised  a number of tests to quantify  divergent thinking, including his  1967 “Alternative Uses Test,” which  asks participants to write as many  uses as they can think of for: (a) a  toothpick, (b) a brick, and (c) a paper  clip. In his “Consequences Test,”  subjects were asked to imagine all  the things that might possibly   happen if all national and local laws  were suddenly abolished. Guilford  scored the answers on levels of four  key components: originality,  ﬂuency, ﬂexibility, and elaboration.  Guilford claims that intelligence  is not made up of just one “general  factor,” but of three different groups  of activities. “Operations” are the  intellectual processes we use; there  are six types of these, including  memory, cognition, and evaluation.  “Content” is the type of information  or data involved—there are ﬁve of  these, including visual and auditory  content. “Products” are the results of  applying operations to content, such  as classes or relations, and there  are six of these. The many ways in  which we combine and use these  different types means there may be  anything up to 180 (6 × 5 × 6) types  of intelligence—more than 100 of  these have already been veriﬁed.

NADPH служит эффективным донором своего  гидрид-иона другим молекулам по той же причине, по которой ATP легко пере- дает фосфат: в обоих случаях передача сопровождается большим отрицательным  изменением свободной энергии.

Очищенный  регуляторный белок смешивают с боль- шим количеством коротких фрагментов  ДНК с разными последовательностями  нуклеотидов. Набор таких фрагментов  ДНК можно получить путем программи- рования синтезатора ДНК — аппарата,  который химически синтезирует ДНК  любой желаемой последовательности  (описан в главе 8). Например, существует  411, или приблизительно 4,2 миллиона,  возможных нуклеотидных последова- тельностей для фрагмента ДНК из 11  нуклеотидов. Затем двухцепочечные  фрагменты ДНК, которые прочно связы- ваются с регуляторным белком, отделяют  от не связавшихся с белком фрагментов  ДНК. Один из методов, который может  быть использован для такого разделе- ния, — это метод сдвига электрофоре- тической подвижности, как показано на  рис. 7.27. После отделения комплексов  ДНК–белок от свободной ДНК связан- ные с белком фрагменты ДНК отделяют  от белков и используют обычно еще в  нескольких дополнительных циклах того  же самого процесса отбора (не показано).

bio.pdf,ru,693,"Связанные с ДНК белки-активаторы могут увеличивать интенсивность ини- циации транскрипции в 1 000 раз — величина, отвечающая относительно слабым  и неспецифическими взаимодействиям между активатором и РНК-полимеразой.  Например, изменение сродства РНК-полимеразы к ее промотору в 1 000 раз соот- ветствует изменению ΔG на 4 ккал/моль, что отвечает появлению только несколь- ких слабых, нековалентных связей. Таким образом, белки-активаторы генов могут  просто обеспечивать несколько благоприятных взаимодействий, которые помогают  привлечь РНК-полимеразу к промотору. Как и при негативном контроле, осуществляемом репрессорами, активаторы  транскрипции могут действовать и как часть простого генетического переключа- теля. Например, бактериальный белок CAP (catabolite activator protein; белок- активатор катаболизма) активирует гены, которые дают возможность E. coli ис- пользовать альтернативные источники углерода, когда предпочитаемый ею источник  углерода — глюкоза, не доступен. Падение уровня глюкозы вызывает возрастание  концентрации циклического АМP — внутриклеточной сигнальной молекулы,  которая связывается с CAP, что позволяет ему присоединиться к специфической  последовательности ДНК вблизи целевых промоторов и, следовательно, включить  соответствующие гены. Таким образом, включение и выключение экспрессии це- левого гена зависит от концентрации в клетке циклического АМP: включается при  высокой, выключается при низкой. На рис. 7.37 обобщены различные способы  использования позитивной и негативной регуляции экспрессии генов. Активаторы и репрессоры транскрипции имеют сходную структуру. Напри- мер, триптофановый репрессор и активатор транскрипции CAP содержат мотив  спираль-виток-спираль (см. рис. 7.11) и для их связывания с ДНК необходим  низкомолекулярный кофактор. Фактически некоторые бактериальные белки, вклю- чая CAP и репрессор бактериофага лямбда, могут действовать и как активаторы,  и как репрессоры в зависимости от конкретного местоположения распознаваемой  ими последовательности ДНК относительно промотора: если участок связывания  белка перекрывает промотор, то полимераза не может связаться, и белок действует  как репрессор (рис. 7.38).

bio.pdf,ru,476,"5.4.4. Сопряжение процесса репарации Днк с транскрипцией гаран- тирует исправность наиболее значимой для клетки части Днк Вся содержащаяся в клетке ДНК находится под постоянным контролем на  предмет наличия повреждений, и механизмы репарации, которые мы описали, несут  свое «дежурство» во всех частях генома. Однако клетки имеют способ направлять  процессы репарации ДНК к тем последовательностям, которые особенно срочно  востребованы. Они делают это, связывая РНК-полимеразу — фермент, который  транскрибирует ДНК в РНК на первом этапе экспрессии генов, —с исправлением  поврежденной ДНК. РНК-полимераза застопоривается в местах повреждения ДНК  и с помощью сопряженных с ней белков направляет машины репарации к таким  участкам. У бактерий, гены коих относительно коротки, застопоренная РНК- полимераза может отделиться от ДНК, ДНК репарируется и ген транскрибируется  снова — с самого начала. У эукариот, гены коих могут быть чрезвычайно длинны,  используется более сложная реакция, призванная «придержать» РНК-полимеразу,  отремонтировать повреждение и затем повторно запустить полимеразу. Сопряженная с транскрипцией репарация работает по механизмам выреза- ния оснований, вырезания нуклеотидов и прочими репарирующими машинами,  чтобы, случись повреждение, незамедлительно направить все необходимое к самым  важным последовательностям ДНК клетки, и именно к тем, которые экспрессиру- ются в данный момент. Что примечательно, репарация данного типа — процесс,  специфичный к матричной цепи транскрибируемой ДНК; другая цепь исправ- ляется с той же скоростью и эффективностью, что и ДНК, которая вообще не  транскрибируется. Сопряженная с транскрипцией репарация особенно важна для  человека, потому что в каждый момент времени транскрибируется лишь малая  доля нашего генома. Важность этого механизма можно проследить на индивидах  с синдромом Кокейна — заболевания, которое вызвано дефектом сопряженной с  транскрипцией репарации. Эти больные страдают замедлением роста, отклонениями  в строении скелета, прогрессирующей атрофией нервной системы и повышенной  чувствительностью к солнечному свету. Большинство этих проблем, как думают,  является результатом остановки (застопоривания) молекул РНК-полимеразы — раз  и навсегда — на участках повреждений ДНК, которые расположены в областях  жизненно важных генов.

bio.pdf,ru,563,"Мы увидели, что выбор участков сплайсинга зависит от таких особенностей  транскрипта пре-мРНК, как сродство «машины» сплайсинга к трем сигналам на  РНК (5'- и 3'-границам сплайсинга и точке ветвления), сотранскрипционная сборка  сплайсосомы и «бухгалтерия», лежащая в основе определения экзона. Мы не знаем,  насколько точно происходит сплайсинг в норме, потому что, как увидим позже,  существует несколько систем контроля его «качества», которые быстро уничтожают  молекулы мРНК, сращивание которых идет неправильно. Однако нам известно, что  по сравнению с другими этапами экспрессии гена сплайсинг необычайно пластичен.  Например, мутация в последовательности нуклеотидов, критически важной для вы- резания какого-либо конкретного интрона, не обязательно препятствует вырезанию  этого интрона бесповоротно. Вместо этого мутация обычно порождает новую схему  сплайсинга (рис. 6.35). Чаще всего экзон попросту пропускается (рис. 6.35, б). В  других случаях мутация обусловливает эффективное использование скрытого сайта  сплайсинга (рис. 6.35, в). Очевидно, сплайсирующие машины эволюционировали  таким образом, чтобы выбирать наилучшую из возможных схем границ сплайсинга,  и если оптимальная схема повреждена мутацией, то они будут искать следующую  по оптимальности схему и так далее. Такая гибкость процесса сплайсинга РНК  предполагает, что изменения в профилях сплайсинга, вызываемые случайными  мутациями, были важной составляющей эволюции генов и организмов. Пластичность сплайсинга РНК также означает, что клетка может регули- ровать схему РНК-сплайсинга. Ранее в этом параграфе мы говорили о том, что  альтернативный сплайсинг может дать начало различным белкам, получаемым из  одного и того же гена. Некоторые примеры альтернативного сплайсинга носят кон- ститутивный характер — то есть альтернативно сплайсированные молекулы мРНК  постоянно производятся клетками организма. Однако во многих случаях клетка  регулирует схемы сплайсинга таким образом, что в разное время и в различных  тканях производятся разные формы данного белка (см. рис. 6.27).

Так, если бактерии и эукариоты отделены друг от друга более чем  на 3 000 миллионов лет расходящейся (дивергентной) эволюцией, то позвоночные  животные и насекомые отделены друг от друга примерно 700 миллионами лет, рыбы  и млекопитающие — примерно 450 миллионами лет, а различные виды цветковых  растений — лишь приблизительно 150 миллионами лет. Ввиду близости эволюционных отношений между всеми цветковыми растениями  мы можем еще раз проникнуть в суть клеточной и молекулярной биологии всего  этого класса организмов, сосредоточиваясь для детального анализа лишь на одном  или нескольких видах. Из нескольких сотен тысяч цветковых растений, населяю- щих Землю в наши дни, молекулярные биологи сконцентрировали свои усилия на  маленьком сорняке, обычной резушке Таля Arabidopsis thaliana (рис. 1.46), кото- рый можно выращивать в закрытом помещении в больших количествах и получать  тысячи потомков от одного растения через каждые 8–10 недель.

Первый  ген Lac-оперона, LacZ, кодирует фермент β-галактозидазу, которая расщепляет лактозу на галактозу и  глюкозу. При добавлении лактозы происходит увеличение концентрации аллолактозы, изомера лакто- зы, которая связывается с Lac-репрессором и вызывает его отсоединение от ДНК. Добавление глюкозы  приводит к уменьшению концентрации цикло-АМР (cAMP), и, поскольку cAMP больше не связан с CAP,  этот белок-активатор отделяется от ДНК, выключая оперон. На рисунке обобщены основные черты Lac-оперона, но в действительности ситуация намного сложнее.  Существует несколько участков связывания Lac-репрессора, расположенных в различных местах ДНК.  Приведенный участок связывания оказывает наибольшее воздействие, но для полного подавления  экспрессии необходимы и другие сайты (см. рис. 7.40). Кроме того, экспрессия Lac-оперона никогда  полностью не выключается.

bio.pdf,ru,637,"Хотя РНК и кажется весьма подходящей для формирования базового на- бора самореплицирующихся биохимических катализаторов, ясности, что именно  РНК была первым видом молекул, которые сыграли эту роль, пока нет. Чисто с  химической точки зрения трудно вообразить, сколь долго молекулы РНК могли  образовываться в самом начале, когда в их распоряжении были лишь нефермен- тативные пути достижения этой цели. Начнем с того, что предшественники РНК,  рибонуклеотиды, трудно образовать неферментативным путем. Более того, для  образования РНК необходимо, чтобы длинный ряд фосфодиэфирных связей 3'–5'  был собран вопреки набору конкурирующих реакций, в том числе: гидролиз, об- разование связей 2'–5' и связей 5'–5'. Исходя из этих проблем, было высказано  предположение о том, что первыми молекулами, которые обладали и каталитической  активностью, и способностью хранить информацию, возможно, были полимеры,  которые напоминают РНК, но устроены химически проще (рис. 6.100).

bio.pdf,ru,273,"3.2.17. Два лиганда, участки связывания которых сопряжены, ока- зывают взаимное влияние на связывание с этим ферментом Воздействие связывания лиганда на белок проистекает из фундаментального  химического принципа, известного как взаимосвязь, или сопряжение. Предпо- ложим, например, что некоторый белок, который связывает глюкозу, связывает  также и другую молекулу X на участке, расположенном на каком-то расстоянии  от глюкозосвязывающего. Если участок связывания молекулы X изменяет свою  форму как часть конформационного изменения, вызванного связыванием глюкозы,  то участки связывания молекул X и глюкозы, как говорят, сопряжены. Как следует  из основных начал термодинамики, если два лиганда предпочтительно связывают- ся с одной и той же конформацией аллостерического белка, то каждый из этих  лигандов должен увеличивать сродство данного белка ко второму лиганду. Таким  образом, если переход белка на рис. 3.58 в замкнутую конформацию, которая свя- зывает глюкозу наилучшим образом, обусловливает также и лучшее соответствие  Х-участка связывания молекулам X, то при наличии молекул Х такой белок будет  связывать глюкозу сильнее, чем в их отсутствие. И наоборот, механизм сцепления развивается по негативному сценарию, если  два лиганда предпочитают связываться с различными конформациями одного и  того же белка. В таком случае связывание первого лиганда препятствует связы- ванию второго лиганда. Таким образом, если изменение конформации, вызванное  связыванием глюкозы, уменьшает сродство белка к молекуле X, то связывание  молекулы X будет тоже снижать сродство белка к глюкозе (рис. 3.59). В количе- ственном отношении действие двух сопряженных лигандов тоже взаимосвязано,  так что, например, если глюкоза оказывает очень сильное влияние на связывание  вещества X, то вещество X очень сильно влияет на связывание глюкозы. Зависимости, представленные на рис. 3.58 и 3.59, относятся ко всем белкам,  и лежат в основе всей клеточной биологии. В ретроспективе, в которой мы теперь  воспринимаем их как нечто само собой разумеющееся, они кажутся вполне очевид- ными. Но открытие сопряжения в ходе изучения нескольких ферментов в 1950-х гг.,  за которым последовал всесторонний анализ аллостерических механизмов в белках  в начале 1960-х, произвело революционный эффект в нашем понимании биологии.  Поскольку молекула X в этих примерах связывается с ферментом на некотором  участке, который отделен от участка, где происходит катализ, она может быть  представлена любым веществом и не «состоять в родственной связи» – в химиче- ском отношении – с глюкозой или любым другим лигандом, который связывается  с этим ферментом в активном участке. Более того, как мы только что убедились,  для ферментов, которые регулируются подобным образом, молекула X может либо  «включать» фермент (положительная регуляция), либо «выключать» его (отрица- тельная регуляция). Благодаря такому механизму аллостерические белки служат  главными переключателями, которые, в принципе, позволяют какой-либо одной  молекуле в клетке влиять на метаболическое будущее любой другой молекулы.

bio.pdf,ru,536,"Действительно, сравнение множества различных бактериальных промоторов по- казывает удивительную степень разнообразия. Тем не менее все они содержат  родственные последовательности, отражающие отчасти те черты ДНК, которые  напрямую распознаются фактором σ. Такие общие особенности часто сводятся в  форму консенсусной последовательности (consensus nucleotide sequence; рис. 6.12).  Консенсусную последовательность нуклеотидов получают путем сравнения мно- жества последовательностей с одинаковой основной функцией и последующего  расчета наиболее часто встречающихся нуклеотидов в каждой позиции. Поэтому  она служит итоговой, или усредненной, последовательностью для большого числа  индивидуальных нуклеотидных последовательностей. Последовательности ДНК индивидуальных бактериальных промоторов, таким  образом, определяют их силу (число событий инициации на данном промоторе в  единицу времени). Эволюционные процессы подстроили каждый из них таким  образом, чтобы он «запускал» транскрипцию столь часто, сколь это необходимо,  и так создали широкий ассортимент промоторов. Промоторы для генов, которые  кодируют распространенные белки, намного сильнее, чем приписанные к генам,  которые кодируют минорные белки, — и именно в нуклеотидных последователь- ностях промоторов кроются эти различия. Подобно бактериальным промоторам, последовательности терминаторов транс- крипции также заменяются в широком диапазоне, с потенциалом к формированию  простой шпилечной структуры РНК, что является самой важной их общей осо- бенностью. Так как такой потенциал присущ фактически неограниченному числу  нуклеотидных последовательностей, терминаторные  последовательности еще более  разнообразны, чем промоторные. Мы обсудили бактериальные промоторы и терминаторы немного подробнее,  чтобы проиллюстрировать важный момент, относящийся к анализу последователь- ностей геномов. Хотя мы многое знаем о бактериальных промоторах и терминаторах  и можем строить консенсусные последовательности, которые подытоживают их  наиболее яркие особенности, разнообразие их нуклеотидных последовательностей  мешает точно определять их местонахождение путем непосредственного анализа  нуклеотидной последовательности генома. Еще более трудно определить место- нахождение аналогичных последовательностей в геномах эукариот, отчасти из-за  «избыточности» ДНК, в них заложенной. Часто нам бывает нужна дополнительная  информация, часть которой можно получить при проведении экспериментальных  исследований, чтобы определить местонахождение и точно интерпретировать ко- роткие сигналы ДНК, содержащиеся в геномах. Так как ДНК двухцепочечная, с любого гена, в принципе, могут быть транс- крибированы две разные молекулы РНК, если каждую из двух цепей ДНК ис- пользовать как матрицу. Однако ген, как правило, имеет только один промотор,  и, поскольку нуклеотидная последовательность промотора асимметрична (см. рис.  6.12), полимераза может связаться с соответствующим участком ДНК только в  одной ориентации. Полимераза синтезирует РНК в направлении 5' → 3' и может  поэтому транскрибировать только одну из цепей, охватываемых геном (рис. 6.13).  Последовательности геномов показывают, что цепь ДНК, используемая как матрица  для синтеза РНК, меняется от гена к гену — в зависимости от местоположения и  ориентации промотора (рис. 6.14).

ДНК, по  всей вероятности, была поздним дополнением: по мере того как накопление  дополнительных белковых катализаторов позволяло клеткам развиваться в  более эффективные и сложные системы, двойная спираль ДНК заменяла РНК,  будучи более устойчивой молекулой для хранения возраставших количеств  генетической информации, необходимой таким клеткам.

При биосинтезе макромолекул это достигается путем переноса  фосфатных групп с образованием химически активных фосфорилированных  промежуточных продуктов. Поскольку энергетически неблагоприятная реакция  теперь становится энергетически благоприятной, гидролиз ATP, можно сказать,  «продвигает» реакцию. Полимерные молекулы, такие как белки, нуклеиновые  кислоты и полисахариды, собираются из маленьких активированных молекул- предшественников в ходе повторяющихся реакций конденсации, движущей силой  которых тоже является гидролиз ATP.

bio.pdf,ru,134,"2.2.9. концентрация реагентов влияет на изменение свободной  энергии и на направление протекания реакции Как только что было описано, реакция Y ↔ X протекает в направлении Y → X,  когда этот процесс сопряжен с отрицательным значением изменения свободной  энергии ΔG, — так же как и сжатая пружина, будучи предоставлена сама себе,  разожмется и потеряет запасенную в ней энергию во внешней среде в виде выде- лившейся теплоты. В случае химической реакции, однако, ΔG зависит не только  от энергии, запасенной в каждой отдельной молекуле, но также и от концентрации  молекул в реакционной смеси. Вспомним, что ΔG отражает степень, с которой ре- акция создает более неупорядоченное — другими словами, более вероятное — со- стояние Вселенной. Если вспомнить приводимую нами ранее аналогию с монетами,  то становится весьма вероятным такое событие, когда некоторая монета изменит  свою ориентацию с орла на решку, если во встряхиваемом ящике находится 90 ор- лов и 10 решек; однако это событие станет менее вероятным, если ящик будет со- держать 10 орлов и 90 решек. То же самое верно и для химической реакции. В случае обратимой реакции  Y ↔ X при большом избытке Y над X реакция будет преимущественно проходить  в направлении Y → X; то есть система будет стремиться к такому состоянию,  чтобы в ней было больше молекул, осуществляющих переход Y → X, чем моле- кул, совершающих переход X → Y. Если отношение Y к X увеличивается, то ΔG  становится более отрицательным для перехода Y → X (и более положительным  для перехода X → Y). Какая разность концен- траций необходима, чтобы ком- пенсировать данное уменьше- ние энергии химических связей  (и сопутствующее высвобожде- ние теплоты)? Ответ интуитив- но не очевиден, но эта разность  может быть определена из термо- динамического анализа, который  позволяет разделить зависимые  от концентрации и независимые  от концентрации части уравне- ния изменения свободной энер- гии. Выражение ΔG для данной  реакции можно, таким образом,  записать в виде суммы двух ча- стей: первая, называемая изме- нением стандартной свободной  энергии ΔG°, зависит от инди- видуальных характеристик реа-     Рис. 2.51.

Отрицательно заряженная аспарагиновая кислота реагирует с атомом углеро- да C1 искаженного сахара, а глутаминовая кислота жертвует свой протон кислороду,  который связывает этот сахар с соседним. В результате связь между этими двумя  сахарами расщепляется, и боковая цепь аспарагиновой кислоты остается ковалентно  связанной с С1, по которому и произошло расщепление связи. 3. При помощи отрицательно заряженной глутаминовой кислоты молекула воды  реагирует с атомом углерода C1, вытесняя боковую цепь аспарагиновой кислоты  и завершая процесс гидролиза. Полная химическая реакция — от начального связывания полисахарида на  поверхности фермента и до заключительного высвобождения разобщенных цепей  происходит во много миллионов раз быстрее, чем протекала бы в отсутствие фер- мента. Другие ферменты используют подобные механизмы для снижения энергии  активации и ускорения реакций, которые они катализируют. В реакциях, где во  взаимодействие вовлечено два и более агентов, активный участок служит также и  матрицей, или шаблоном, на которой, или соответственно котором, эти субстраты  «сводятся вместе» в надлежащей ориентации так, что реакция между ними становится  возможной (рис. 3.52, а). Как мы видели на примере лизоцима, атомы, входящие  в активный участок фермента, размещены очень точно, чтобы ускорять реакцию  за счет использования своих заряженных групп для изменения распределения  электронов в субстратах (рис. 3.52, б). Кроме того, когда субстрат связывается с  ферментом, связи в субстрате часто искажаются, изменяя форму субстрата. Эти  изменения, наряду с механическими силами, продвигают субстрат к специфиче- скому переходному состоянию (рис. 3.52, в). Наконец, подобно лизоциму, многие  ферменты оказываются глубоко вовлеченными в реакцию и даже образуют крат- ковременную ковалентную связь между субстратом и боковой цепью входящей в  активный центр аминокислоты фермента. На последующих этапах реакции боковая  цепь возвращается в свое исходное состояние, так что сам фермент остается неиз- мененным после реакции (см. также рис. 2.72). ",2066,1609,,

Точно так же как  люди употребляют инструменты, чтобы увеличить и расширить возможности своих  рук, белки часто используют маленькие небелковые молекулы, чтобы выполнять  функции, которые было бы трудно или невозможно выполнить, располагая одними  лишь аминокислотами. Так, белок сигнальных рецепторов родопсин, который про- изводится фоторецепторными клетками сетчатки, обнаруживает свет посредством  маленькой, заложенной в него, молекулы ретиналя (рис. 3.53, а). Когда ретиналь  поглощает фотон света, он изменяет свою форму, и это изменение заставляет белок  запускать каскад ферментативных реакций, которые в конечном счете ведут к по- сылке электрического сигнала мозгу. Другим примером белка, содержащего небелковую часть, служит гемоглобин  (см. рис. 3.22).

hist.pdf,ru,625,"После революции 1848 г. ускорилось разорение словенского крестьянства, подвергавше- гося эксплуатации со стороны помещиков и буржуазии (главным образом австрийской и итальянской). Австрийский крупный капитал быстро расширял свои позиции в экономике Словении, связанной с общеимперским рынком железной дорогой Вена—Триест (построена в 1857 г.). Подавляемые конкуренцией австрийских и чешских фабрик приходили в упадок старинное ремесло и мелкие промыслы. В 1869 г. австрийские капиталисты организовали «Крайнское промышленное общество», захватившее в свои руки значительную часть добычи и обработки металла. В стране, в ос- новном сохранявшей аграрный характер, среди множества мелких мастерских появлялись отдельные крупные предприятия. Словенская буржуазия продолжала укрепляться как в сель- ском хозяйстве, так и в области торговли и кредитно-ростовщических операций. В 1860-х годах в словенских областях возникла сеть «читален» — центров национальной культуры и политической деятельности, а в 1864 г. — издательское общество «Словенская матица». Консервативные церковные и землевладельческие круги заняли крайне умеренную позицию в национальном вопросе. Выступая против централизаторской политики австрий- ских либералов, они отстаивали лишь употребление словенского языка в школах и админи- страции. Из страха перед демократическим движением они защищали верность религиозным принципам в политике и культуре. Другое крыло словенского национального движения составили либералы, отражавшие ин- тересы торговых и еще весьма слабых промышленных кругов. Защищая национальный ры- нок от натиска австрийского капитала, они выдвинули лозунг объединения словенских зе- мель и автономии Словении. Преобразование империи в дуалистическую, свидетельство- вавшее об отказе австрийских властей дать Словении автономию, нанесло удар националь- ным чаяниям словен и вызвало негодование в словенских землях. В 1868—1870 гг. повсюду происходили народные собрания («таборы»), на которых раздавались требования нацио- нальной автономии для Словении. Однако это обращение к народным массам, втягивавшимся в политическую борьбу, вско- ре показалось опасным буржуазии, и либералы, вначале принимавшие активное участие в этой агитации, прекратили кампанию таборов.

hist.pdf,ru,548,"Урегулирование взаимоотношений крестьян с помещиками было поручено особым миро- вым посредникам, которые назначались из числа местных помещиков-дворян. Контроль за их деятельностью осуществляли особые учреждения, состоявшие из тех же мировых посред- ников и губернских чиновников. Административно-судебная власть помещиков над крестьянами была отменена в конце 1861 г. К тому времени были образованы волости, объединявшие соседние деревни и села с количеством мужского населения от 300 до 2000 человек, и были осуществлены выборы кре- стьянами сельской администрации и суда (старост — в отдельных селениях и старшин, а также других должностных лиц и судей — в волости). Регламентацию хозяйственных отношений между крестьянами и помещиками намечалось осуществить в течение двух лет. За этот срок помещики обязаны были заполнить особые ус- тавные грамоты, в которых указывалось фактическое количество земли, находившееся в пользовании крестьян в каждом имении, и исчислялись размеры надельной земли и повин- ностей крестьян по нормам, указанным в законе 19 февраля 1861 г. После проверки содержа- ния уставной грамоты мировым посредником она оглашалась перед крестьянскими уполно- моченными и считалась утвержденной, если со стороны последних не делалось «законных возражений». С момента утверждения уставных грамот крестьяне на неопределенно длительный срок становились временнообязанными, так как были обязаны выполнять в пользу помещиков ус- тановленные законом повинности. Они освобождались от этих обязательств и становились крестьянами-собственниками лишь после того, как с согласия помещика заключали особое соглашение о выкупе надельной земли. Таким образом, освобождение от крепостной зависимости на основании закона 19 февра- ля 1861 г. проходило длительно и мучительно тяжело для крестьян. Многие помещики не спешили с отказом от привычных для них форм феодальной эксплуатации крестьян. Даже через 10 лет после провозглашения отмены крепостного права в России на положении вре- меннообязанных продолжало находиться свыше 30% всех крестьянских хозяйств. По закону 19 февраля 1861 г. крестьяне получали «в пользо- вание» избы с огородами и земельные наделы, если они были у них по спискам 10-й ревизии (1858 г.). Полностью лишались наделов крепостные крестьяне южного берега Крыма, где на- ходилось много имений членов царской семьи и титулованной знати. Совсем не обеспечива- лись землей бывшие дворовые. Предусмотренные в законе нормы крестьянских наделов были намеренно занижены, осо- бенно значительно в черноземных районах. Это давало помещикам возможность уже при со- ставлении уставных грамот резко сокращать крестьянское землепользование и за его счет увеличивать барскую запашку. Помимо того, закон предоставлял помещикам право обеззе- меливать крестьян и другими способами: склонять их на получение в собственность без вы- купа всего лишь 1/4 надела, лишать особо ценных угодий и т. д. В целом «отрезки» в пользу помещиков по всей России достигали 18% общей площади надельного фонда, который нахо- дился в распоряжении помещичьих крестьян до реформы. Во многих черноземных губерни- ях в центре, на юге страны и в Нижнем Поволжье эти «отрезки» составляли от 20 до 40% всей надельной земли. За предоставленные им усадьбы и наделы временнообязанные крестьяне оброчных име- ний должны были вносить помещику сумму, равную среднему оброку, взимавшемуся в дан- ной местности перед отменой крепостного права. Крестьян фактически заставляли платить за уменьшенный надел прежний оброк. К тому же размер такого оброка, возмещавшего по- мещикам доход и от внеземледельческих промыслов крестьян, никак не соответствовал ка- честву надельной земли. В барщинных имениях крестьяне отрабатывали за каждый душевой надел 70 дней в году. Но три пятых из этих дней они обязывались работать в краткий период полевых работ, что равнялось примерно прежней трехдневной барщине. ",3870,2429,,
hist.pdf,ru,738,"После поражения восстания декабристов Пушкин начинает пристально всматриваться в реальную действительность, изучает жизнь народа в прошлом и настоящем, стремится к ис- торической объективности, непоколебимой реалистической правде. Опираясь на Карамзина и собственное изучение источников, он создает национальную историческую трагедию «Бо- рис Годунов» (1824—1825 гг.), посвященную «эпохе многих мятежей» начала XVII в. Уди- вительное проникновение в дух русской старины, строгая и ясная форма трагедии поставили ее на огромную высоту в русском и мировом искусстве. В конце 20-х годов Пушкин обратился к образу Петра I. В поэме «Полтава» (1828 г.), цен- тральный момент которой составляет полтавское сражение, и в первых главах неоконченно- го исторического романа «Арап Петра Великого» поэт с исторической объективностью изо- бражает переломную эпоху в жизни России. С 1823 г. Пушкин работает над величайшим своим созданием — романом в стихах «Евге- ний Онегин» (1823—1831 гг.). В «Онегине» дана широкая картина жизни русского общества, а в лирических отступлениях романа многообразно отражается личность самого поэта, то задумчивого и грустного, то язвительного и шутливого. В «Евгении Онегине» Пушкин реа- листически продолжает то, что начал в романтических поэмах более раннего периода, — раскрытие образа своего современника, молодого человека дворянской эпохи в русском об- щественном движении XIX в. «Маленькие трагедии» (30-е годы) рисуют столкновение дерзкой человеческой личности с законами, традицией и авторитетом. Пушкин высоко ценит красоту свободной индивидуаль- ности, но он осуждает демонический эгоизм, отдавая предпочтение безыскусной народной правде. Эта тема своеобразно преломляется и в повести «Пиковая дама» (1833 г.), в которой изображен носитель эгоистической страсти к обогащению, стремящийся сорвать приз жизни, любой ценой подняться вверх. В поэме «Медный всадник» (1833 г.) Пушкин воплотил свои представления об историче- ском развитии. В старом обществе прогресс осуществлялся ценой страданий личности. Мел- кий чиновник Евгений поднимает бунт против «державца полумира», но в страхе отступает, ибо нельзя задержать неумолимый ход истории, нельзя помешать ему. Особое внимание Пушкина привлекает проблема крестьянских движений. Он коснулся этой темы в романе «Дубровский» (1832—1833 гг.), но не довел ее до конца. Тщательно изу- чив все доступные ему материалы о Пугачеве, собрав сведения на месте восстания, Пушкин создает книгу «История Пугачева», первое историческое исследование о крестьянской войне XVIII в. Опираясь на художественные принципы Вальтера Скотта, Пушкин написал «Капи- танскую дочку» (1836 г.), историческую повесть с классической ясностью сюжетных линий и глубиной психологических характеристик. В «Капитанской дочке» Пушкин показал не только стихийный характер крестьянского движения, но и его поэзию, и его обреченность. Неповторимая красота искусства Пушкина с огромной силой проявилась в его лирике. Лирика Пушкина не менее глубоко раскрывает внутренний мир человека, чем лирическая поэзия романтиков, но у великого поэта душа и сердце гармонически сочетаются с могучей силой разума. Произведения Пушкина овеяны духом гуманности. По глубине чувства и классической гармонии формы они вместе с лирическими стихотворениями Гёте принадле- жат к лучшим созданиям мировой поэзии. Пушкин был центральной фигурой русской литературы первых десятилетий XIX в. Бе- линский прямо называет этот период русской литературы «пушкинским». С именем Пушки- на связан не только высокий расцвет русской поэзии, но и формирование русского литера- турного языка. Пушкин показал духовную красоту и мощь русского человека, прелесть род- ной природы, народной поэзии — сказок, песен, преданий. Его значение для русской литера- туры неизмеримо. «Он у нас начало всех начал», — говорил о Пушкине Горький. ",3831,2501,,

Возникновение капиталистического способа производства относится еще к XVI в. Однако развитие капитализма в первый, мануфактурный, период его существования (XVI—XVIII столетия) происходило медленно. Длительный, «инкубационный», по выражению Маркса, этап машинного производства только в конце XVIII в. привел к промышленному перевороту, да и то лишь в Англии. Совсем иные темпы характерны для последующего периода, когда революционизирующее воздействие крупной машинной индустрии обнаружилось со всей силой. Если в начале промышленного переворота ручной труд был вытеснен только в одной отрасли промышленности — хлопчатобумажном прядении, то в последующие десятилетия процесс замены ручного труда машинами распространился почти на все отрасли промыш- ленности. К 1870 г. в передовых странах Европы и в Соединенных штатах Америки прочно установилось господство крупной машинной индустрии. Капитализм содействовал развитию производительных сил не только в промышленности, но и в сельском хозяйстве. Еще в начале XIX в. даже в передовых странах — Англии, Гол- ландии и др. — все основные операции в сельском хозяйстве (посев, уборка, обмолот, сено- кошение и т.д.) производились, за редким исключением, при помощи ручного труда. Во вто- рой трети XIX в. началось на первых порах очень медленное, но постепенно все более бы- строе внедрение машин в сельское хозяйство; одновременно с этим впервые стали приме- няться химические удобрения. Благодаря использованию пара огромный скачок произошел в области транспорта. Лишь в 30-х годах XIX в. железнодорожное строительство вышло из стадии технического экспе- риментирования. В 1840 г. длина мировой железнодорожной сети не превышала 9 тыс. км. К 1870 г. железнодорожные пути протянулись не только по всей Европе, но начали строиться и в Азии, связали атлантическое и тихоокеанское побережья на американском континенте, а общая их протяженность достигла 210 тыс. км.

В начале XIX в. в России продолжался процесс по- степенного разложения крепостничества и развития капиталистических элементов в хозяйст- ве страны. Особенно заметны были сдвиги в области промышленности. На основе развития мелких промыслов возникали мануфакту- ры, принадлежавшие купцам и разбогатевшим крестьянам. Они использовали наемный труд и обслуживали массовый рыночный спрос. В 1804 г. в России насчитывалось около тысячи мануфактур (не считая горных заводов) при 95 тыс. рабочих, из которых почти половина были наемными. К началу XIX в. относятся первые опыты применения машинной техники в текстильном производстве. Однако в уральской металлургии по-прежнему господствовал принудительный труд. Новые черты наметились и в сельском хозяйстве. В первые годы XIX в. возникли новые отрасли, имевшие промышленное значение: начались посевы сахарной свеклы, стало разви- ваться тонкорунное овцеводство и т. д. Но крепостнические отношения не позволяли осуще- ствить радикальную перестройку помещичьих хозяйств. Основная масса помещиков-дворян практиковала прежние привычные формы эксплуата- ции крестьян. Помещики увеличивали свои доходы путем расширения барской запашки за счет уменьшения крестьянских наделов, путем усиления барщины и повышения оброка. Все это обостряло отношения между помещиками и крестьянами. ",1524,1363,,
hist.pdf,ru,111,"Хотя эта миссия прибыла в Тегеран уже после заключения в Тильзите франко-русского сою- за, она развила в Иране активную деятельность, направленную не только против Англии, но и против России. В то же время Гардан навязал Ирану кабальный торговый договор. Французское преобладание в Иране оказалось весьма кратковременным. В 1809 г. англи- чанам удалось заключить новый союзный договор с Ираном и изгнать оттуда французов. Англия стала выплачивать шаху ежегодную военную субсидию в 200 тыс. туманов для веде- ния войны против России. С 1810 г. англичане возобновили в широких масштабах поставку вооружения в Иран. Прибывшие туда многочисленные английские офицеры не только про- должили начатое французами обучение иранских войск, но и приняли непосредственное участие в военных действиях против России. Английская дипломатия систематически сры- вала начинавшиеся время от времени мирные Переговоры России с Ираном и добивалась за- ключения им союза с Турцией, направленного против России. Оказанная англичанами помощь не могла, однако, сколько-нибудь существенно улучшить состояние вооруженных сил Ирана и предотвратить его поражение. К тому же на стороне России активно боролись и народы Закавказья. Много грузин и армян сражалось в рядах русских войск. В составе русской армии имелись азербайджанские и армянские отряды, бое- вые заслуги которых не раз отмечались русским командованием. Местное население оказы- вало ожесточенное сопротивление иранцам. Население округа Казах в 1805 г. собственными силами изгнало вторгшиеся иранские отряды Мужественно сопротивлялись повторным на- шествиям иранских войск и жители Карабаха — азербайджанцы и армяне. В октябре 1812 г. в битве у Асландуза русские войска разгромили армию иранского пре- столонаследника Аббаса-мирзы и вскоре овладели крепостью Ленкорань Шахское прави- тельство вынуждено было возобновить мирные переговоры с Россией Согласно подписан- ному в 1813 г. Гюлистанскому мирному договору Иран признал присоединение основной части Закавказья к России, но удержал под своей властью Ереванское и Нахчеванское ханст- ва. Лишь Россия могла держать на Каспийском море военный флот. Купцы обеих сторон по- лучали право беспрепятственной торговли с уплатой ввозной пошлины не более 5% от стои- мости товара. ",2259,1738,,

Восторже- ствовавшая контрреволюция начала расправу с участниками революционного движения.

hist.pdf,ru,746,"Тургенев не ограничился изображением «лишних людей». В романе «Накануне» (1860 г.) он показал болгарского революционера Инсарова, за которым самозабвенно пошла русская девушка Елена Стахова. Но Тургенев искал героя, сложившегося на русской почве и посвя- тившего себя служению России. Такой образ он нашел в лице разночинца Базарова, изобра- женного им в романе «Отцы и дети» (1862 г.). Базаров отрицает поэзию и возвышенные чув- ства, которыми гордятся представители дворянской среды (поэтому он в их глазах — «ниги- лист», отрицатель), он думает, что главная задача состоит в распространении естественных наук. Хотя некоторые черты Базарова коробят писателя, Тургенев изображает все же своего героя как глубокую и трагическую личность, истинного гиганта рядом с мелкими фигурами образованных помещиков. Но, как писал Ленин, Тургенева «тянуло к умеренной монархической и дворянской кон- ституции ...ему претил мужицкий демократизм Добролюбова и Чернышевского» 1. Такого рода тенденции проскальзывали у Тургенева уже в «Отцах и детях»; более отчетливо они проявились в поздних романах — «Дым» и «Новь». В последние годы своей жизни писатель почти постоянно жил за границей. Он выступал на Западе в роли пропагандиста русской литературы; его собственные произведения во мно- гом способствовали ее мировому влиянию. Выдающийся русский романист Иван Александрович Гонча- ров (1812—1891) разделял с русскими просветителями вражду к крепостному праву и веру в то, что его уничтожение принесет благоденствие России. Од- нако по своим политическим воззрениям Гончаров склонялся к либерально-консервативной позиции. Романы Гончарова «Обыкновенная история» (1847 г.) и «Обломов» (1859 г.) поя- вились до 1861 г., т. е. до окончательного размежевания либеральных и демократических тенденций. Как и Тургенев, Гончаров испытал на себе влияние Белинского. В «Обыкновен- ной истории» он осмеял дворянский романтизм, праздность и беспочвенность дворянских мечтателей. Лучшим созданием Гончарова является роман «Обломов». В образах Ильи Ильича Обло- мова и его слуги Захара он воплотил типы патриархального барина и слуги крепостной эпо- хи. Гончаров наделил Обломова умом, талантом, благородными намерениями, но все это еще резче оттеняет паразитизм, инертность патриархального уклада помещичьей жизни, пода- вившего в конце концов все лучшие задатки героя. Ленин высоко ценил то разоблачение патриархальщины, неподвижности, барской лени, которое дал Гончаров в понятии «обло- мовщины». Последний роман Гончарова «Обрыв» появился в 1869 г. В «Обрыве» сказалось враждебное отношение писателя к революционной демократии, но и в этой книге создан ряд ярких образов представителей старой патриархально-помещичьей России. Художник огромного таланта, Федор Михайлович Достоев- ский (1821—1881) был сложным и противоречивым писате- лем. Он создал непревзойденные по силе и выразительности картины страданий людей под гнетом капитализма, но отвергал революционный путь и в течение многих лет вел ожесто- ченную борьбу против идей революционно-демократического лагеря. Достоевский вступил в литературу как представитель «натуральной школы», продолжая традиции Пушкина и Гоголя. Его первая повесть «Бедные люди» (1846 г.) была восторженно встречена Белинским. В этой повести Достоевский с глубоким сочувствием изображает страдания «бедных людей», живущих в большом городе, защищает достоинство простого человека, показывает его превосходство над представителями аристократии. Но уже в этой повести проявились в зародыше некоторые черты будущих воззрений Достоевского. Он не видит в «маленьком человеке» способности к протесту и борьбе, не верит в возможность ак- тивного воздействия на действительность. ",3679,2444,,
hist.pdf,ru,549,"Для обеспечения исправного поступления с крестьян платежей и выполнения ими повин- ностей сохранялось общинное землепользование и вводилась круговая порука: все сельское общество несло материальную ответственность за каждого своего члена. Такой общинный порядок был узаконен в подавляющем большинстве великорусских губерний, в трех «ново- российских» губерниях (Екатеринославской, Таврической и Херсонской), отчасти в Харь- ковской, а также в Могилевской и в ряде уездов Витебской губернии. Сохранение поземель- ной общины по замыслу правительства должно было также помешать пролетаризации кре- стьянства. Сроки выкупа усадьбы определялись самими крестьянами. Они могли в любое время внести в казначейство установлен- ную законом сумму выкупа (до 60 руб.) и через шесть меся- цев получали документ на полное владение избой и приусадебным участком. Для выкупа же земельного надела требовалось предварительное согласие помещика. Сумма выкупа за надел, огромная для рядового крестьянского бюджета, искусственно оп- ределялась на основании величины годового оброка, взимавшегося с временнообязанных крестьян. Этот оброк приравнивался к ежегодной ренте, исходя из чего исчислялась величи- на выкупа, которая при 6% обеспечивала бы помещику получение прежнего дохода. Таким образом, при оброке в 12 руб. сумма выкупа устанавливалась в 200 руб., при оброке в 9 руб. она составляла 150 руб. и т. д. Выкуп за надел, как правило, намного превышал рыночную стоимость земли, особенно в нечерноземных губерниях, где земля ценилась обычно дешево, а оброк был особенно высок. Для осуществления выкупа наделов крестьяне обязывались единовременно внести налич- ными 20—25% всей выкупной суммы. Остальные 75—80% сразу выплачивались помещику государством, которое начисляло эту сумму в качестве долга на крестьян. Крестьяне должны были погашать этот долг с процентами в форме ежегодных выкупных платежей на протяже- нии 49 лет. Выкупная операция была выгодна не только для помещиков, немедленно получавших в свое распоряжение крупный капитал, но и для самого правительства, которое удержало при этом с помещиков огромный долг, числившийся на заложенных в казну имениях.

hist.pdf,ru,418,"В Валахии освободительное движение переросло в револю- цию и привело, хотя на короткий срок, к переходу власти из рук феодальной знати в руки представителей оппозиционного боярства и буржуазии. Боль- шую роль в событиях 1848 г. в Валахии сыграло тайное общество «Справедливость и брат- ство», добивавшееся ликвидации феодальных привилегий, образования национальной ва- лашской армии, освобождения страны от турецкого господства и создания независимого ру- мынского государства. Душой этой организации был революционный публицист Николай Бэлческу, виднейший буржуазно-демократический деятель того времени. 21 июня 1848 г. члены общества «Справедливость и братство» организовали в деревне Излаз многолюдное народное собрание, в котором приняли участие местные крестьяне, а также солдаты и офицеры расположенных там войск. Собрание приняло прокламацию, вы- двигавшую ряд буржуазно-демократических требований: независимость Валахии, свобода печати, образование национальной гвардии, созыв Учредительного собрания для выработки конституции и т. д. Два пункта этой программы касались положения феодально-зависимых крестьян (клакашей) и крепостных цыган: программа требовала освобождения их от крепо- стнического гнета на условиях компенсации помещиков. О наделении крестьян землей ниче- го не было сказано. Излазская прокламация послужила толчком к революционным выступлениям в различных частях страны. 23 июня на улицах Бухареста тысячи людей двинулись к дворцу господаря Георгия Бибеску с возгласами «Да здравствует конституция!» Господарь согласился принять условия, выдвинутые в излазской прокламации, и сформировал Временное правительство, в состав которого вошли большею частью умеренные буржуазные либералы. В правительство вступил и Бэлческу. Через два дня после этого господарь, испуганный совершенным на него покушением, а также неповиновением части офицеров и солдат, отрекся от престола и бежал за границу. Временное правительство провело некоторые прогрессивные реформы. Но главный во- прос — аграрный — оно оставило нерешенным. Между тем успешный исход революции за- висел прежде всего от ее поддержки массами крестьянства. Нерешенность аграрного вопроса вызывала стихийные крестьянские выступления. Крестьяне почти повсеместно отказывались выполнять феодальные повинности, рубили помещичьи леса, косили сено на боярских зем- лях, выгоняли свой скот на помещичьи луга и поля. Аграрное движение продолжалось до конца 1848 г., сопровождаясь вооруженными столкновениями с полицией и войсками. Ничего не сделало Временное правительство и для решения такой важной задачи, как достижение национальной независимости Валахии. Ободренные половинчатой политикой Временного правительства, контрреволюционные круги боярства вскоре подняли голову. 1 июля контрреволюционные офицеры во главе воо- руженного отряда ворвались во дворец, где заседало правительство, и арестовали некоторых его членов. В ответ на эту вылазку контрреволюции толпы народа окружили дворец, вступи- ли в бой с мятежниками и добились освобождения арестованных членов правительства. Де- сять дней спустя в Бухаресте была предпринята новая попытка контрреволюционного пере- ворота, но выступление народных масс снова расстроило замыслы реакции. Убедившись в том, что восстановить старый режим в Валахии с помощью одних только сил внутренней реакции невозможно, султанское правительство направило в княжество свои войска. В начале октября сильная турецкая армия вступила в Бухарест. Сопротивление, оказанное революционными горожанами, было жестоко подавлено. По соглашению между Россией и Турцией ряд районов страны был оккупирован царскими войсками. ",3616,2362,,
hist.pdf,ru,370,"Предреволюционные годы отмечены народными волнениями почти во всех странах Европы. Во Франции 1847 год ознаме- новался многочисленными выступлениями народных масс, происходившими почти повсеме- стно, главным образом в форме продовольственных волнений: городская и сельская беднота нападала на хлебные склады и лавки спекулянтов. Широко развернулось стачечное движе- ние. Правительство жестоко расправлялось с участниками этих выступлений. В Англии оживилось чартистское движение, происходили массовые митинги. Новая пе- тиция, подготовленная для передачи в парламент, содержала резкую критику существующе- го общественного строя и требовала предоставления национальной свободы Ирландии. В Германии ранней весной 1847 г. в ряде городов произошли стихийные выступления на- родных масс. Особенно серьезными были волнения в столице Пруссии — Берлине. 21 и 22 апреля голодающий народ вышел на улицу, протестуя против дороговизны и равнодушия властей к народным нуждам. Несколько лавок было разгромлено, во дворце наследника пре- стола разбиты стекла. На почве обострения классовых противоречий происходил подъем революционных на- строений пролетариата. В то же время усиливалась оппозиционность мелкой и средней бур- жуазии, а в некоторых странах, например во Франции, также и части крупной промышлен- ной буржуазии, недовольной господством финансовой аристократии. Летом 1847 г. оппозиционные круги французской буржуазии начали в Париже «банкетную кампанию». На банкетах произ- носились речи, в которых критиковалась политика правитель- ства.  Инициатива  кампании  исходила  от  умеренно- либеральной партии, получившей название «династической оппозиции». Партия эта не шла дальше требований частичной избирательной реформы, посредством которой буржуазные либералы рассчитывали укрепить пошатнувшееся положение царствующей династии. Руко- водитель партии адвокат Одилон Барро выдвинул типичный для умеренных либералов ло- зунг: «Реформа во избежание революции!» Однако вопреки стараниям «династической оппо- зиции» банкеты в пользу избирательной реформы постепенно стали принимать более ради- кальный характер. На банкете в Дижоне видный деятель левого крыла буржуазных респуб- ликанцев адвокат Ледрю-Роллен произнес тост: «За Конвент, спасший Францию от ига коро- лей!» «Кризис верхов» обнаружился и в Пруссии. В кругах буржуазной оппозиции усиливалось стремление ограничить власть короля и добиться расширения прав парламента. Финансовые затруднения заставили прусское правительство созвать в апреле 1847 г. «Соединенный ланд- таг» — собрание представителей всех восьми провинциальных ландтагов. Но когда вожди либеральной оппозиции потребовали превращения Соединенного ландтага в парламентское законодательное учреждение, король заявил, что никогда не согласится на введение консти- туционных порядков. После того как ландтаг отказался утвердить предложенный правитель- ством заем, король распустил ландтаг. Политическая обстановка сильно обострилась также в других частях Германии. В сентяб- ре 1847 г. в городе Оффенбурге собрался съезд представителей демократического крыла буржуазной оппозиции Бадена. Съезд потребовал введения демократических свобод, созыва общегерманского парламента, отмены привилегий дворянства, преобразования армии, ре- формы налоговой системы. В октябре в городе Геппенгейме съезд умеренно-либерального крыла буржуазной оппозиции принял резолюцию о созыве общегерманского парламента для объединения страны под главенством Пруссии. В Баварии в начале февраля 1848 г. дело дошло до открытых столкновений между населением и войсками. ",3559,2335,,

Царская ар- мия в Венгрии насчитывала около 140 тыс. солдат, австрийская армия — 127 тыс. человек, им противостояли венгерские войска численностью около 170 тыс. человек. Решающие бои между венгерской армией и главными силами русских и австрийских войск произошли 7 и 11 июля у Комарома. Венгры были разбиты; после этого австрийцы снова заняли Будапешт. Венгерское революционное правительство переехало в город Сегед. Военные неудачи усилили разногласия среди командиров венгерской армии, а также между главой правитель- ства Кошутом и главнокомандующим Гергеем. Кошут подозревал Гергея и его сторонников- офицеров в изменнических замыслах, но не решался открыто разоблачить их перед войска- ми. Колебания Кошута ослабляли положение венгерского революционного правительства. 10 августа Гергей, который в это время уже вел тайные переговоры с командованием царских войск, добился передачи ему диктаторских полномочий. Убедившись в том, что дело проиг- рано, Кошут покинул Венгрию и уехал в Турцию. 13 августа 1849 г. венгерская армия, преданная Гергеем, которому царское правительство обещало помилование и награды, капитулировала при Вилагоше. Военные действия в Венг- рии продолжались еще некоторое время. В конце сентября сдалась крепость Комаром и пре- кратили борьбу остальные очаги сопротивления. Австрийское правительство жестоко расправилось с участниками венгерской революции. 6 октября 1849 г. были казнены 13 генералов венгерской революционной армии и первый премьер-министр Венгрии граф Баттиани. В общем было казнено несколько сот человек, бо- лее 10 тыс. человек заключены в тюрьмы. ",1666,1457,,
hist.pdf,ru,408,"В Италии революционное движение 1848 г. началось с народ- ного выступления на острове Сицилия. Классовые противоре- чия в Сицилии были особенно острыми: безземельное крестьянство и рабочие серных руд- ников жестоко эксплуатировались крупными землевладельцами и капиталистами. В 40-х го- дах под влиянием повторных неурожаев и промышленного кризиса положение трудящихся масс Сицилии стало совершенно невыносимым. Вместе с тем усилилось стремление буржу- азно-дворянских кругов к автономии острова и даже к отделению его от Неаполитанского королевства. 12 января 1848 г. вспыхнуло народное восстание в Палермо, главном городе Сицилии. На помощь восставшим горожанам прибыли крестьяне. Город покрылся баррикадами. Неаполи- танские войска были разбиты и 26 января покинули Палермо. На следующий день в Неаполе состоялась массовая демонстрация с требованием консти- туции. Король дал отставку реакционным министрам и вручил власть деятелям умеренно- либеральной буржуазии. Вскоре в Неаполе была провозглашена конституция. В Сицилии образовалось Временное правительство, в состав которого вошли представи- тели либеральной буржуазии и либерального дворянства. Весь остров, за исключением кре- пости Мессины, где засели неаполитанские войска, признал власть Временного правительст- ва. События в Сицилии и в Неаполе оказали большое влияние на политическую борьбу в дру- гих частях Италии. Под давлением народа в Сардинском королевстве и в Тоскане были изда- ны в марте 1848 г. декреты о введении конституции. Пришлось и папе Пию IX согласиться на введение конституции. Правда, он сделал это несколько позже, чем другие итальянские государи, — только 15 марта. Впервые в истории папского государства там возник совет ми- нистров, в который вошли также лица, не принадлежащие к духовенству. Впрочем, консти- туция Папской области, так же как и конституции Неаполя, Пьемонта, Тосканы, носила весьма умеренный характер. ",1909,1561,,
hist.pdf,ru,273,"Военные силы Шамиля резко сократились. Направленные царским правительством на Кавказ крупные военные соединения в 1859 г. окружили Шамиля с оставшимися у него че- тырьмя сотнями мюридов в ауле Гуниб и вынудили его сдаться в плен. Восстание горцев в западной части Кавказа благодаря поддержке со стороны Англии и Турции продолжалось еще некоторое время и было подавлено в середине 60-х годов. Чем  сильнее  подрывались  основы  самодержавно- крепостнического строя, тем яснее становилась реакцион- ность политики царизма. Николай I упорно охранял господ- ство дворян хозяйственной, общественной и политической жизни страны на всем протяже- нии своего 30-летнего царствования (1825—1855). Это был убежденный и властный крепо- стник, «самодовольная посредственность, с кругозором ротного командира, человек, прини- мавший жестокость за энергию и капризное упрямство за силу воли...» 1 Важнейшим карательным органом царской власти стало учрежденное в 1826 г. III отделе- ние собственной канцелярии царя. Оно ведало политическим сыском и надзором, располага- ло особым корпусом жандармских войск и непосредственно подчинялось самому Николаю I. Казарменно-полицейский режим душил в царской России малейшие признаки сопротив- ления самодержавной власти. Суровые удары правительственных репрессий обрушились на печать и образование. Министр просвещения А. С. Шишков писал царю: «Французская ре- волюция подготовлена была и произошла от слабого смотрения правительства за свободою книгопечатания». Уже весной 1826 г. был введен суровый («чугунный») цензурный устав. Вслед за тем было опубликовано положение о школе, которое придало образованию сослов- ный характер и ограничило прием разночинцев в гимназии и университеты. ",1714,1466,,

Оно началось с Рейнской области. 3 мар- та массовая демонстрация рабочих Кёльна, в подготовке которой участвовала местная общи- на Союза коммунистов, представила городскому совету петицию, которая требовала всеоб- щего избирательного права, уничтожения постоянной армии, всеобщего вооружения народа, «защиты труда и обеспечения человече- ских потребностей для всех», воспитания детей на общественный счет. Демонстранты были разогнаны войсками. 6 марта в Берлине начались сходки и демонстрации, 13 марта они переросли в уличные стычки с войсками. 18 марта толпы народа, окружившие королевский дворец, были атакова- ны войсками, что вызвало бурю возмущения в массах. Улицы Берлина покрылись баррика- дами, начались ожесточенные бои. После того как войска оказались не в состоянии подавить народное движение, правительству пришлось вывести их из Берлина и пойти на некоторые уступки: была объявлена всеобщая амнистия и разрешена организация гражданской гвардии. 29 марта было создано либеральное правительство, во главе которого впервые в истории Пруссии стали представители крупной буржуазии, а не помещиков-дворян. Наиболее вид- ную роль играли в новом правительстве фабрикант Кампгаузен и банкир Ганземан.

hist.pdf,ru,54,"Между тем якобинцы продолжали неуклонно проводить свою политику террора и макси- мума. В начале 1794 г. они сделали попытку осуществить новые социально-экономические мероприятия в ущерб крупным собственникам. 8 и 13 вантоза (конец февраля — начало мар- та) Конвент по докладу Сен-Жюста принял важные, имевшие большое принципиальное зна- чение декреты. Согласно этим так называемым вантозским декретам, собственность лиц, признанных врагами революции, подлежала конфискации и бесплатному распределению среди неимущих. Врагами революции в то время считались не только бывшие аристократы, но и многочисленные представители как старой, фельянской и жирондистской, так и новой буржуазии, в частности спекулянты, нарушавшие закон о максимуме. В вантозских декретах отразились уравнительные устремления якобинцев — учеников и последователей Руссо. Ес- ли бы вантозские декреты удалось провести в жизнь, это означало бы значительное увеличе- ние числа мелких собственников, прежде всего из рядов бедноты. Однако собственнические элементы воспротивились осуществлению вантозских декретов. В то же время внутренняя противоречивость политики якобинцев вела к тому, что росло недовольство и на другом полюсе — в рядах плебейских защитников революции. Якобинцы не обеспечили условий для действительного улучшения материального поло- жения плебейства. Установив под давлением народных масс максимум на продукты питания, якобинцы распространили его и на заработную плату рабочих, причинив им тем немалый вред. Они оставили в силе антирабочий закон Ле Шапелье. Наемные рабочие, преданные борцы революции, самоотверженно трудившиеся на оборону республики, принимавшие ак- тивное участие в политической жизни, в низовых органах революционно-демократической диктатуры — революционных комитетах, революционных клубах и народных обществах, также становились все более недовольными политикой якобинцев. Якобинская диктатура не осуществила и чаяний деревенской бедноты. Распродажу на- циональных имуществ использовала в основном зажиточная верхушка крестьянства, ску- пившая большую часть земли. В эти годы безостановочно усиливалась дифференциация кре- стьянства. Беднота добивалась ограничения размеров «ферм», владений зажиточных кресть- ян, изъятия у них излишков земли и раздела ее между неимущими, но якобинцы не решались поддержать эти требования. Местные органы власти обычно становились на сторону бога- тых крестьян в их конфликтах с сельскохозяйственными рабочими. Все это вызывало и сре- ди малоимущих слоев деревни недовольство якобинской политикой. Обострение внутренних противоречий в стране и кризис ре- волюционной диктатуры привели к борьбе в рядах якобинцев. С осени 1793 г. среди якобинцев начали оформляться две оп- позиционные группировки. Первая из них складывалась вокруг Дантона. Один из влиятель- нейших вождей революции на ее предыдущих этапах, пользовавшийся одно время наряду с Робеспьером и Маратом огромной популярностью в народе, Дантон уже в решающие дни борьбы с жирондистами проявил колебания. По выражению Маркса, Дантон, «несмотря на то, что он находился на вершине Горы... до известной степени был вождем Болота» 1. После вынужденного ухода из Комитета общественного спасения Дантон на время удалился от дел, но, и, оставаясь в тени, он стал притягательным центром, вокруг которого группировались видные деятели Конвента и якобинского клуба: Камилл Демулен, Фабр д'Эглантин и другие. За некоторыми исключениями, все это были лица, прямо или косвенно связанные с быстро растущей новой буржуазией. ",3511,2344,,
hist.pdf,ru,529,"В связи с очередной распрей между католическим и греко- православным духовенством, вспыхнувшей из-за обладания религиозными святынями христиан в Палестине, император Николай I в феврале 1853 г. потребовал от Порты (турецкого правительства) поставить всех православных подданных Османской империи под его покровительство. Порта, за спиной которой стояли Англия и Франция, отклонила домогательства царя. В ответ русские войска перешли в июле 1853 г. реку Прут и оккупировали Молдавию и Валахию, которые находи- лись под сюзеренитетом султана. Николай I был уверен, что таким путем он заставит Порту пойти на уступки, не доводя дело до войны. В военном отношении Россия была значительно сильнее Турции, а вмеша- тельство других держав в русско-турецкий конфликт царь считал немыслимым. Монархи Австрии и Пруссии были его партнерами по Священному союзу; Франция, по его мнению, еще не окрепла после революционных потрясений, а Англия, не имевшая большой армии, вообще сбрасывалась со счета; кроме того, Англия и Франция являлись соперницами на Ближнем Востоке, и союз между ними казался царю невозможным. Царское правительство не видело тех сдвигов, которые произошли в международной об- становке к началу 50-х годов. Англия, Франция и другие европейские державы в это время стремились сговориться между собой за счет экономически отсталой России. Кроме того, правящие круги Англии и Франции в такой же мере, как и царизм, готовы были пойти на внешнеполитические авантюры на Востоке, чтобы укрепить свое господство внутри страны. Поэтому английская и французская дипломатия не пожалела усилий для обострения русско- турецкого конфликта и не остановилась перед самым активным вмешательством в него. Воспользовавшись возникновением русско-турецкого конфликта, англо-французский флот вошел в Мраморное море. Дипломатические отношения между Россией и Турцией бы- ли прерваны. В то же время начались переговоры между правительствами Англии, Франции, Австрии, Пруссии и Швеции об образовании коалиции против России. Демократические силы России и всей Европы, видевшие в царизме главное препятствие на пути политического прогресса, надеялись, что назревающая война развяжет силы евро- пейской революции. К. Маркс и Ф. Энгельс в своих статьях того времени указывали, что наилучшим исходом для дела демократии и прогресса была бы такая война против царизма, которая приблизила бы новую революционную ситуацию и оказалась бы способной перерас- ти затем в войну народов Европы против реакционных правительств. Однако правящие кру- ги европейских держав больше всего боялись такого развития событий. Подрывая позиции России на Ближнем Востоке и укрепляя там свое собственное влияние, они вовсе не желали ослаблять силы царизма вообще, так как рассчитывали и в дальнейшем использовать его для борьбы с революционным движением. Отсюда же проистекало стремление Англии и Фран- ции вести военные действия главным образом в районе Причерноморья. В сентябре 1853 г. турецкое правительство потребовало от России вывода ее армии из Дунайских княжеств и вскоре дви- нуло свои войска в наступление на дунайском и кавказском направлениях.

Венгерская армия приближалась к границе Австрии. 2 мая венгерские отряды за- няли крепость Буду. В этот момент по просьбе австрийского императора на помощь контрреволюции пришло правительство царской России. В мае 1849 г. 100-тысячная армия под начальством фельд- маршала князя Паскевича вступила в Венгрию, а другая русская армия численностью в 40 тыс. человек — в Трансильванию. Передовые круги русской общественности резко осуж- дали выступление царизма против революционной Венгрии. Чернышевский в своем дневни- ке 1849 г. называл себя «другом венгров» и выражал надежду на поражение царских войск, на то, что оно даст толчок восстанию против самодержавия и крепостничества в России.

hist.pdf,ru,778,"Между крупнейшим литературным произведением начала XIX века — романом Ли Жу-чжэня «Цветы в зеркале» (1820 г.) — и первыми стихами (1835 г.) поэта Хуан Цзунь-сяня (1848—1905), посвященны- ми тайпинскому восстанию, лежит более чем сорокалетняя полоса исканий. Значение ее в развитии культуры велико: в эти годы начали проявляться новые черты, которые в более со- вершенной художественной форме определились в китайской литературе только в самом конце XIX в. Среди таких новых черт наибольшую важность имело возрождение политической, соци- альной поэзии. Оно связано с именами выдающихся политических деятелей: Линь Цзэ-сюя, Хун Сю-цюаня, Ши Да-кая. Многие из них были активными участниками тайпинского дви- жения. Их поэтическое творчество явилось попыткой вывести поэзию на широкую полити- ческую арену, дать ей право голоса в общественной жизни. Поэзия, культивируемая в консервативных слоях китайского общества середины XIX в., была представлена тунчэнской школой и школой сунского стиля. Главенствующее положе- ние сначала занимала первая из них; вторая школа сложилась несколько позже, в процессе борьбы с тунчэнской, и постепенно вытеснила ее, заняв прочное место в литературе верхов. Главный эстетический принцип обеих групп состоял в подражании древним образцам (тун- чэнская школа подражала поэзии эпохи Тан; школа сунского стиля — поэтам эпохи Сун) и в пренебрежении к общественной жизни страны. Столпом тунчэнской школы был ярый реак- ционер, палач тайпинского восстания Цзэн Го-фань. В борьбе с эстетическими воззрениями тунчэнской школы впоследствии (в конце 90-х годов XIX в.) формируется «школа новой по- эзии», представленная поэтами-патриотами. Гораздо меньшее значение имели прозаические произведения середины XIX в. Причины этого коренятся отчасти в строгости правительственной цензуры (стихи в отличие от прозы часто распространялись устно), а также в том, что в бурную революционную эпоху крупные писатели были поглощены общественной борьбой. Существенный интерес представляет ав- тобиография одного из вождей тайпинского восстания Ли Сю-чэна, написанная им в нанкин- ской тюрьме перед казнью. На китайской литературе середины XIX в. еще не успело сказаться европейское влияние: первые переводы западных произведений на китайский язык появились лишь в самом конце XIX в. Середина XIX в. ознаменована возникновением в Китае пе- риодической печати современного типа. Первые периодиче- ские издания были основаны западными миссионерами. Вскоре от этих изданий отпочковалась национальная китайская пресса, сумевшая приобре- сти острую патриотическую направленность. В ее создании принимали участие деятели пат- риотического движения: Линь Цзэ-сюй, издававший в Кантоне журнал «Кантонские запис- ки», младший брат вождя тайпинов Хун Жэнь-гань, журналист Ван Тао и другие. Особую роль сыграла деятельность Ван Тао — пропагандиста научных и политических знаний, об- личителя китайского феодального общества. За свою связь с тайпинами он был объявлен вне закона. Вынужденный бежать в Гонконг, он там сотрудничал в газете «Новейшие события», а в 1872 г. вместе с У Тин-фаном и Чэнь Ай-тином основал «Ежедневную газету на китай- ском языке», пользовавшуюся большой популярностью в Южном Китае. Появление перио- дической прессы в Китае имело существенное значение как для роста освободительного движения, так и для развития художественной литературы. ",3359,2303,,
hist.pdf,ru,108,"Распад Иранского государства после смерти Надир-шаха су- щественно изменил политическую обстановку в Закавказье. Зависимость закавказских ханств от Ирана стала во второй половине XVIII в. чисто номинальной. Грузинские царства Картли и Кахетия также сумели отстоять свою независимость и объединились в единое царство. Западная Грузия, находив- шаяся в сфере влияния Турции, продолжала оставаться раздробленной на ряд феодальных владений — Имеретию, Мегрелию, Гурию. В ханствах Закавказья господствовали отсталые феодальные порядки и натуральное хо- зяйство. Крестьянство несло тяжелые феодальные повинности. Основными формами фео- дальной ренты были натуральный оброк и отработочная рента. Произвол феодалов и фео- дальная раздробленность пагубно отражались на развитии торговли и ремесла, сохранявшего средневековый характер. В Картли-Кахетинском царстве крепостнический строй сковывал развитие производи- тельных сил. Крестьяне массами бежали из деревень. Попытки царя Ираклия II несколько ограничить эксплуатацию крестьян, чтобы предотвратить окончательное разорение этих ос- новных производителей и налогоплательщиков, как и меры, принимавшиеся для развития торговли и промышленности, не давали должных результатов. Крупные феодалы — тавады противодействовали также созданию регулярного войска и централизованной системы управления. В Закавказье не прекращались феодальные распри, усобицы. Ханы и другие феодалы со- вершали нападения на владения своих соседей с целью захвата добычи и угона жителей, ве- ли между собой постоянные войны. Непрерывные набеги на Закавказье совершали и даге- станские феодалы. В этих условиях Картли-Кахетинское царство и закавказские ханства не имели возможно- сти защищаться от агрессии Ирана, вновь усилившегося в конце XVIII в., и Турции, стре- мившейся не только удержать в своих руках Западную Грузию, но и подчинить себе Восточ- ное Закавказье. Единственной державой, которая могла оказать народам Закавказья помощь против Ирана и Турции, была Россия. К ней обращались за поддержкой и представители господствующих классов (в том числе представители армянского духовенства и армянской торговой буржуазии, выступавшие в роли активных поборников присоединения Закавказья к России) и местные правители (грузинские цари, азербайджанские ханы), большая часть ко- торых тоже предпочитала власть России иранскому и турецкому владычеству. В 1783 г. Ираклий II подписал договор о вступлении Картли-Кахетинского царства под русский протекторат. Многие закавказские ханы также заявили о своей готовности перейти под покровительство России. В Восточную Грузию были введены два батальона русских войск. Царское правительство уже тогда проектировало присоединить к Российской империи прикаспийские области, а в остальной части Закавказья создать три зависимых от России вассальных государства — Грузию, Армению и Албанию (Азербайджан). Однако междуна- родная обстановка и, в частности, начавшаяся в 1787 г. война с Турцией вынудили царское правительство на время отказаться от осуществления этих планов и даже отозвать русские войска из Грузии. Между тем длительные междоусобицы в Иране завершились в конце XVIII в. победой главы племени каджаров Ага-Мохаммед-хана. Последнему к 1794 г. удалось подчинить сво- ей власти почти весь Иран. Летом 1795 г. Ага-Мохаммед-хан во главе пятидесятитысячной армии вторгся в Закавка- зье. Направив часть своих войск в Ереванское ханство, а другую — в Муганскую степь, он сам с основными силами проник через Карабах и Гянджинское ханство в Грузию и овладел Тбилиси. Грузинская столица была разгромлена и сожжена. Оставшиеся в городе жители были перебиты или уведены в плен. ",3634,2360,,
hist.pdf,ru,393,"В области внешней политики Маркс и Энгельс выдвигали лозунг революционной войны против царской России, являвшейся тогда главным оплотом европейской контрреволюции. Они указывали, что поражение царизма в этой войне приведет к подъему революции в Гер- мании и Австрии, к свержению династии Гогенцоллернов и династии Габсбургов. Внутри рабочего движения в Германии Маркс и Энгельс вели борьбу на два фронта: с од- ной стороны, против Борна, уповавшего на мирное развитие событий, с другой — против Готшалька, считавшего, что Германия может перейти к коммунистической республике, ми- нуя промежуточный, буржуазно-демократический этап революции, и призывавшего рабочих не принимать участия в выборах в общегерманское собрание. Борьба против полуанархист- ской тактики Готшалька завершилась тем, что он потерял свое прежнее влияние среди кёльнских рабочих. В октябре 1848 г. председателем кёльнского «Рабочего союза» был из- бран Маркс. Руководящую роль Маркс играл в «Кёльнском демократическом обществе», а также в «Рейнском окружном комитете демократов», созданном в конце июня 1848 г. Важнейшей задачей немецкой буржуазно-демократической революции 1848 г. было политическое объединение Германии. Большая часть германской буржуазии добивалась объедине- ния Германии под главенством Пруссии. Этот путь преду- сматривал исключение из Германии владений монархии Габс- бургов, поэтому его сторонники получили название «малогерманцев». Второй путь объеди- нения Германии предусматривал объединение всех территорий Германского союза, в едином германском государстве во главе с Австрией.

hist.pdf,ru,164,"В 20-х годах были сделаны попытки объединения старых товариществ подмастерьев, так называемых «компаньонажей», прежде враждовавших между собой. Тогда же возникли об- щества взаимопомощи рабочих и подмастерьев («Общество взаимопомощи каменотесов го- рода Парижа» в 1820 г., «Общество взаимопомощи парижских плотников» в 1823 г. и т. п.), а также рабочие ссудо-сберегательные кассы. Все эти рабочие организации были еще очень далеки от понимания задач классовой борь- бы пролетариата. Но они тем не менее имели важное значение, так как давали рабочим воз- можность уяснить преимущества коллективной борьбы для защиты своих интересов. Рабочие все чаще стали прибегать к стачкам. В 1824 г. в Нанте бастовали рабочие, выра- батывавшие саржу, в Суз-ан-Тарбе — рабочие бумажных фабрик. В 1825— 1827 гг. проис- ходили стачки жестянщиков и оцинковщиков в Париже, каменщиков в Париже и в Булони, стекольщиков в Комментри. Некоторые забастовки приводили к вооруженным столкновениям рабочих с полицией. Так, забастовка 800 рабочих прядильной мануфактуры в Ульме (близ Руана) в 1825 г. сопро- вождалась сражением между рабочими и жандармерией, в помощь которой был двинут ба- тальон королевской гвардии. Забастовка была подавлена вооруженной силой. Одного из за- бастовщиков — рабочего Рустеля по решению суда казнили; многих других стачечников приговорили к тюремному заключению и каторжным работам. Отталкивающие черты капиталистического строя — эксплуа- тация человека человеком, власть денег, — составлявшие рез- кий контраст с провозглашенными в период революции принципами свободы, равенства и братства, заставляли передовых мыслителей задумываться над тем, как изменить сущест- вующий общественный строй. Разочарованные результатами буржуазной революции, они приходили к выводу, что ре- волюция оказалась способной лишь разрушить старое общество, но не смогла построить но- вое, так как нельзя было признать разумным и нормальным строем возникшее после рево- люции буржуазное общество с его индивидуализмом, культом наживы, преклонением перед золотым тельцом, с его социальными несправедливостями. Искренне сочувствуя невзгодам и страданиям трудящихся масс, эти мыслители гневно клеймили капитализм, разоблачали его язвы и пороки, противопоставляя ему идеал нового общественного строя, без эксплуатации и социальных противоречий. Социалистические учения того времени неизбежно носили утопический характер. В нача- ле XIX столетия не было еще общественных предпосылок для возникновения научного со- циализма. «...В это время, — писал Энгельс, — капиталистический способ производства, а вместе с ним и противоположность между буржуазией и пролетариатом были еще очень неразвиты... Это историческое положение определило взгляды и основателей социализма. Незрелому со- стоянию капиталистического производства, незрелым классовым отношениям соответство- вали и незрелые теории» 1. Социалисты-утописты не были способны раскрыть законы развития капиталистического общества, историческую роль пролетариата. В статье «Три источника и три составных части марксизма» Ленин, характеризуя утопический социализм начала XIX в., писал: «Он крити- ковал капиталистическое общество, осуждал, проклиная его, мечтал об уничтожении его, фантазировал о лучшем строе, убеждал богатых в безнравственности эксплуатации. Но утопический социализм не мог указать действительного выхода. Он не умел ни разъ- яснить сущность наемного рабства при капитализме, ни открыть законы 1 Ф.

Многие из этих солдат видели в Наполеоне угнетателя своего народа и не желали воевать за чуждые им захватнические цели французского императора. Наполеон рассчитывал разгромить основные русские силы в генеральном сражении еще вблизи от границы; затем он намеревался идти на Москву и здесь продиктовать свои условия мира. Не располагая обученными резервами, крепостная Россия в начале войны смогла выста- вить по сравнению с армией Наполеона вдвое меньшие силы. Правда, русские войска отли- чались высокими боевыми качествами, имели весьма одаренных военачальников: Багратио- на, Барклая де Толли, Дохтурова, Раевского и многих других.

Нахимова уничтожила у Синопа стоявший там турецкий флот. Это опрокинуло расчеты английских и французских политиков на затяжную войну между Россией и Турцией и заставило их ввести в действие собственные вооруженные силы. В марте 1854 г. Англия и Франция объявили войну России. Англо-французский флот бло- кировал морские побережья России, а получившая подкрепление турецкая армия снова раз- вернула наступление на Дунае и в Закавказье.

В сен- тябре 1854 г. в Крыму была высажена англо- франко-турецкая армия. Она разбила в сражении при Альме значительно уступавшие ей по численности и вооружению русские войска (английские и французские войска были воору- жены винтовками, русские — старыми гладкоствольными ружьями, с несравненно меньшей дальнобойностью и скорострельностью) и подступила к Севастополю. Севастополь представлял в то время первоклассную военно-морскую базу, способную от- разить нападение англо-французского флота. Но он не имел укреплений с суши, а после от- ступления русской армии его гарнизон был по сути дела оставлен на произвол судьбы. Руко- водство обороной города взяли на себя адмиралы В. А. Корнилов и П. С. Нахимов. Они за- топили часть кораблей, загородив флоту противника вход в бухту, а команды судов направи- ли на линию обороны. Туда же была перевезена часть корабельных орудий. Моряки, солдаты и помогавшие им жители города в короткое время соорудили вокруг Севастополя восемь бастионов, вооруженных тяжелой артиллерией, и превратили, таким образом, город в на- стоящую крепость.

hist.pdf,ru,470,"Однако все эти восстания носили локальный характер, происходили разрозненно и, как правило, не объединялись с тайпинским движением. Этому препятствовала религиозная не- терпимость тайпинских руководителей, которая отталкивала от них не только последовате- лей различных тайных обществ, но и многих крестьян и представителей городских низов на территории, занятой тайпинами. Все это ослабляло силу крестьянской войны. Народные восстания, происходившие в различных районах страны одновременно с тайпинским восстанием, облегчали борьбу тайпинов против правительственных войск. Но благоприятное для тайпинов развитие военных действий было парализовано начавшейся междоусобицей в Нанкине. К этому времени глава тайпинского государства Хун Сю-цюань устранился от дел. Многие тайпинские руководители — выходцы из народа — погибли в бо- ях. Среди оставшихся в живых сподвижников Хун Сю-цюаня не было единодушия. Против Ян Сю-цина, фактически возглавлявшего правительство и армию Тайпин тяньго и представ- лявшего демократические тенденции в тайпинском руководстве, выступила сильная группи- ровка, созданная выходцем из помещиков честолюбивым Вэй Чан-хоем, стремившимся за- хватить руководство государством в свои руки. Не без содействия со стороны Хун Сю- цюаня, недовольного чрезмерным сосредоточением власти в руках Ян Сю-цина, Вэй Чан-хой организовал заговор, который привел в сентябре 1856 г. к убийству Ян Сю-цина и несколь- ких тысяч его сторонников. Вэй Чан-хой захватил власть в Нанкине, но против него выступил видный тайпинский полководец Ши Да-кай, тоже выходец из помещиков, вначале тайный союзник Вэй Чан-хоя. Дальнейшая борьба между тайпинскими руководителями привела к убийству Вэй Чан-хоя, к установлению в Нанкине правительства Ши Да-кая и, наконец, к разрыву последнего с Хун Сю-цюанем. Ши Да-кай ушел из Нанкина в юго-западные провинции, уведя с собой главные силы тайпинской армии в надежде обосноваться в районах, где происходили в это время крестьянские восстания (Гуанси, Сычуань). Однако Ши Да-кай в этом походе не смог в дос- таточной мере привлечь на свою сторону крестьянство юго-западного Китая. В итоге все его планы создания новой базы потерпели крах; в 1863 г. при переправе через реку Даду в Сы- чуани отряд Ши Да-кая был разбит цинскими войсками, а сам он схвачен и казнен. Внутренняя борьба крайне ослабила лагерь тайпинов. С 1857 г. военная и политическая власть в тайпинском государстве сосредоточилась в руках родственников и земляков Хун Сю-цюаня, которые в большинстве своем не были сторонниками глубоких революционных преобразований. Во внутренней политике тайпинов получили преобладание консервативные тенденции. Тайпинские руководители, имевшие титулы ванов, обогащались и все более от- рывались от народа. Все это постепенно расшатывало устои тайпинского государства. Дис- циплина в армии, в прошлом основанная на преданности командиров и солдат делу освобо- ждения китайского народа, сильно упала. Воспользовавшись сложившейся обстановкой, ар- мия маньчжурского правительства перешла в наступление против тайпинов. Тайпины вновь были вынуждены оставить Учан. Вскоре военные действия были перене- сены в восточный Хубэй, а также в Цзянси, Аньхой и Цзянсу и, наконец, непосредственно в район Нанкина. В этих боях в качестве главного руководителя тайпинской армии выдвинул- ся полководец Ли Сю-чэн, прошедший путь от рядового солдата до крупнейшего военачаль- ника. Ли Сю-чэн стремился возродить народный характер тайпинской армии. Возглавив борьбу за спасение тайпинского государства, он нанес ряд серьезных поражений войскам маньчжуро-китайских феодалов. Но эта героическая борьба велась в неблагоприятных усло- виях, когда капиталистические державы Европы, а также США открыто выступили против тайпинов. ",3741,2529,,
hist.pdf,ru,319,"В течение всей первой половины XIX в. Турецкая военно- феодальная империя оставалась в состоянии глубокого внут- реннего кризиса. Это облегчало дальнейшее усиление эконо- мического и политического влияния иностранных государств на Турцию. Особенно заметных успехов добилась Англия, опередившая в своем экономиче- ском развитии другие страны мира. Англия всемерно старалась подчинить себе турецкий сырьевой рынок и обеспечить возможно лучшие условия для сбыта своих товаров. Для этого Англия в 1838 г. заключила с султанским правительст- вом торговую конвенцию, запрещавшую ему вводить на всей территории империи, включая Египет, экспортные монополии и устанавливавшую низкую (пятипроцентную) таможенную пошлину на ввозимые английские товары. Такую же конвенцию с Турцией вскоре подписала и Франция. В Сирии и Ливане, где энергично развернули свою деятельность французские католические миссии, непрерывно возрастало экономическое влияние Франции. Проникновение США на Ближний Восток, начавшееся с конца XVIII в., было закреплено в 1830 г. американо-турецким торговым договором, по которому США получили в Турции такие же права и привилегии, что и европейские державы. В середине 30-х годов США уже вели значительную торговлю с Турцией. Главными предметами вывоза в США были шерсть, ковры; США ввозили в Турцию бумажные ткани, краски и др. Несколько иной путь проникновения на Ближний Восток избрала Пруссия. Она обратила свое внимание на турецкие вооруженные силы и в 1836 г. направила в Турцию военных ин- структоров, в том числе капитана Гельмута фон Мольтке (будущий фельдмаршал). Лишь значительно позднее в Турции появились немецкие предприниматели и финансисты. ",1666,1464,,

Линейная комбинация  признаков, такая как  Во времена, когда не было компьютеров и все вычисления приходилось выполнять  вручную, ученые отдавали предпочтение моделям линейной классификации. В ту  пору они подметили, что если определить отрицательную метку как 0, а положи- тельную метку как 1, достаточно найти простую непрерывную функцию с областью  значений (0, 1). В этом случае, если значение, возвращаемое моделью для образца x,  ближе к 0, ему присваивается отрицательная метка; иначе образец маркируется как  положительный. Одной из функций, обладающих таким свойством, является стан­ дартная логистическая функция (также известная как логистический сигмоид): где e — основание натурального логарифма (также называется числом Эйлера;  значение ex в языках программирования также известно как функция exp(x)). Ее  график изображен на рис. 3.3. ",988,1037,,
ml.pdf,ru,46,"Взглянув на график стандартной логистической функции, можно заметить,  насколько хорошо она соответствует нашей цели классификации: если соот- ветствующим образом оптимизировать значения w и b, результат f(x) можно  интерпретировать как вероятность, что yi будет иметь положительное значение.  Например, если она выше или равна пороговому значению 0.5, мы бы сказали, что  класс x положителен; иначе — отрицателен. На практике могут выбираться другие  пороговые значения, в зависимости от решаемой задачи. Мы вернемся к этой теме  в главе 5, когда будем говорить об оценке эффективности модели. ",595,865,,

Представьте, что у нас есть модель,  которая для любого слова может сгенерировать вектор вложения, обладающий  следующим свойством: если по значению слово yi похоже на слово yk, векторы  вложения этих двух слов должны быть одинаковыми. Например, если yi — это  Париж, а yk — Рим, они будут иметь похожие векторные представления; с другой  стороны, если yk — это картошка, векторы вложения слов yi и yk должны быть  разными. Такие векторы вложения называют вложениями слов (word embeddings)  и обычно сравниваются с использованием мер косинусного сходства1. ",678,889,,

Согласно такому определению, слово пчела будет иметь такое вложение:  [1, 0, 0, 1]. Слово желтый — такое: [0, 1, 0, 1]. Слово единорог — такое: [1, 1, 0, 0].

Прогрессивный рост могущества  толпы совершился прежде всего путем распространения  известных идей, которые медленно насаждались в умах,  и затем — посредством постепенного образования ассо- циаций индивидов с целью осуществления теоретиче- ских построений.

phil.pdf,ru,267,"А в последующие семьдесят лет сколько перемен про- изошло в мнениях толпы! «Коварный Альбион» стано- вится в начале этого века союзником Франции при на- следнике Наполеона, и Россия, подвергавшаяся дважды  нашему нашествию и так радовавшаяся нашей последней  неудаче, внезапно стала признаваться нами лучшим на- шим другом. В литературе, искусствах и философии такие переме- ны совершаются еще быстрее. Романтизм, натурализм,  мистицизм и т. п. нарождаются и погибают один за дру- гим, и артист и писатель, которые вчера еще превозноси- лись нами, сегодня уже возбуждают только одно глубокое  презрение. Если мы будем анализировать все эти перемены, ка- жущиеся нам столь глубокими, то увидим, что все, что  противоречит общим верованиям и чувствам расы, име- ет лишь эфемерное существование и на время уклонив- шееся течение реки возвращается всегда снова к своему  прежнему направлению. Мнения, не связанные ни с ка- ким общим верованием или чувством расы и, следова- тельно, не имеющие прочности, находятся во власти вся- ких случайностей, другими словами, зависят от малей- ших изменений среды. Возникнув под влиянием внушения и заразы, мнения  эти всегда имеют временный характер: они нарождаются  и исчезают, иногда с такой же быстротой, как песчаные  дюны, наносимые ветром на берегу моря. В наши дни количество подвижных мнений толпы  стало больше, нежели когда-либо, и это обусловливается  следующими тремя причинами. Первая причина — это  постепенное ослабление прежних верований, которые  все более и более теряют свою власть и не могут уже дей- ствовать на преходящие мнения толпы, давая им извест- ное направление. Исчезновение общих верований пре- доставляет место массе частных мнений, не имеющих ни  прошлого, ни будущего. ",1739,1441,,
phil.pdf,ru,226,"В предшествующей главе мы изучили отдаленные  и подготовительные факторы, развивающие в душе толпы  особенную восприимчивость, благодаря которой в толпе  возникают известные чувства и идеи. Теперь нам нужно  рассмотреть факторы, действующие на толпу непосред- ственным образом. В следующей главе мы увидим, как  надо обращаться с этими факторами, чтобы они оказали  свое действие. В первой части нашего труда мы изучили чувства, идеи  и рассуждения толпы и можем отсюда вывести общее за- ключение о способах воздействия на душу толпы. Мы уже  знаем, что поражает воображение толпы, какой силой и за- разительностью обладают внушения, особенно те, которые  представляются в форме образов; но так как происхожде- ние внушений бывает весьма разнообразно, то и факторы,  способные действовать на душу толпы, могут быть очень  различны; поэтому-то и необходимо изучить их отдельно,  и такое изучение не будет бесполезной работой.

phil.pdf,ru,250,"Идеи, распространяемые путем утверждения, повторения  и заразы, обязаны своим могуществом главным образом  таинственной силе, которую они приобретают, — оба- янию. Идеи или люди, подчинявшие себе мир, господство- вали над ним преимущественно благодаря этой непрео- долимой силе, именуемой обаянием. Мы все понимаем  значение этого слова, но оно употребляется часто в таких  различных смыслах, что объяснить его нелегко. Обаяние  может слагаться из противоположных чувств, например,  восхищения и страха. В основе обаяния действительно  часто заложены именно эти чувства, но иногда оно су- ществует и без них. Наибольшим обаянием, например,  пользуются умершие, следовательно, существа, которых  мы не боимся: Александр, Цезарь, Магомет, Будда. С дру- гой стороны, есть такие предметы и фикции, которые ни- сколько не возбуждают в нас восхищения, например чу- довищные божества подземных храмов Индии, но кото- рые тем не менее имеют огромное обаяние. В действительности обаяние — это род господства ка- кой-нибудь идеи или какого-нибудь дела над умом ин- дивида. Это господство парализует все критические спо- собности индивида и наполняет его душу удивлением  и почтением. Вызванное чувство необъяснимо, как и все  чувства, но, вероятно, оно принадлежит к тому же поряд- ку, к какому принадлежит очарование, овладевающее за- магнитизированным субъектом. Обаяние составляет са- мую могущественную причину всякого господства; боги,  короли и женщины не могли бы никогда властвовать без  него. ",1492,1342,,

История народов действи- тельно может иногда давать повод предполагать, что ду- ши их по временам претерпевают очень быстрые и зна- чительные изменения. Не кажется ли вам, например, что  существует значительная разница между характером ан- гличанина времен Кромвеля и характером современного  англичанина? Не является ли для вас современный ита- льянец, осторожный и хитрый, совершенно отличным от  порывистого и свирепого человека, каким нам его опи- сывает в своих мемуарах Бенвенуто Челлини? Не идя так  далеко, ограничимся пределами Франции. Сколько про- изошло видимых перемен в характере французов за нич- тожное число веков и иногда даже лет? Какой историк не  отмечал различий в характере между XVII и XVIII века- ми? И в наши дни: не кажется ли вам, что существует про- пасть между характерами непреклонных членов конвента  и послушных рабов Наполеона? Однако это были одни и те же люди, и в несколько лет  они кажутся совершенно изменившимися. Чтобы разъяснить причины этих изменений, мы долж- ны прежде всего вспомнить, что психологический вид,  подобно анатомическому, состоит из очень небольшого  числа основных неизменных особенностей, вокруг кото- рых группируются изменяемые и непостоянные второ- степенные признаки. Скотовод, изменяющий видимую  структуру какого-нибудь животного, садовник, переде- лывающий внешний вид какого-нибудь растения до та- кой степени, что неопытный глаз с трудом его может уз- нать, нисколько не коснулись основных особенностей  вида; они только действовали на его побочные признаки.

Таковы были, например,  Ней и Мюрат во времена первой империи. В наше время  таким был Гарибальди, не обладавший никакими особен- ными талантами, но очень энергичный, сумевший овла- деть целым неаполитанским королевством, располагая  лишь горстью людей, тогда как королевство имело в сво- ем распоряжении дисциплинированную армию для своей  защиты. Но энергия этих вожаков, хотя и очень могуществен- ная, держится недолго и исчезает вместе с возбудителем,  вызвавшим ее появление. Очень часто герои, проявив- шие такую энергию, вернувшись к обыденной жизни,  обнаруживали самую изумительную слабость и полную  неспособность руководить своими поступками даже при  самых обыкновенных условиях, хотя они с виду так хо- рошо умели руководить другими людьми. Такие вожаки  могут выполнять свою функцию лишь при том условии,  если ими руководят и возбуждают их постоянно и если  всегда над ними находится человек или идея, указываю- щие им их поведение.

Вовсе не нужно идти в Индию, чтобы видеть глубокие  изменения, каким подвергался ислам, переходя от одной  расы к другой. Достаточно посмотреть на Алжир. Он за- ключает в себе две совершенно различные расы: арабов  и берберов, одинаково мусульман. Но от ислама первых  до исламизма последних очень далеко; полигамия Ко- рана превратилась в моногамию у берберов, религия ко- торых есть только соединение ислама со старым языче- ством, царившим между ними в течение многих веков,  когда еще господствовал Карфаген. И религии Европы не ускользнули от общего закона —  видоизменяться сообразно с душой принимающих их рас.

В результате, вместо уравнения второго порядка (содержаще- го вторую производную координаты, т.е. ускорение) получили уравне- ние первого порядка (содержит скорость), которое по физике эквива- лентно исходному уравнению движения. Однако, введенные понятия,  такие как работа, кинетическая энергия, закон сохранения механиче- ской энергии оказываются очень плодотворными и помогают проще  решать многие задачи.  Было установлено, что есть большой класс потенциальных сил  (взаимодействий), работа которых зависит только от начальной и ко- нечной точки, а не от конкретного пути, что позволяет ввести понятие  потенциальной энергии. Потенциальной энергия определяется с точно- стью до константы, поэтому за ноль может быть принята любая удоб- ная точка (например, бесконечность, для убывающих сил). При движе- нии под действием таких сил полная энергия, равная сумме кинетиче- ской и потенциальной энергии, сохраняется. Действие непотенциаль- ной силы (такой как сила трения) приводит к изменению полной энер- гии.  Было установлено, что в системе частиц, связанных потенциальны- ми силами, для нахождения суммарной потенциальной энергии нужно  просто просуммировать потенциальные энергии всех пар частиц.  Энергия каждой пары зависит только от расстояния между частицами.  Для нахождения потенциальной энергии двух частиц нужно “закре- пить” одну из частиц (любую) и найти работу по перемещению второй  частицы от места нахождения до места, откуда отсчитывается потен- циальная энергия (или наоборот, но тогда с обратным знаком).

phys.pdf,ru,245,"§ 98. Введение       Завершая изучение курса механики и теории относительности стоит  сделать небольшой экскурс в квантовую механику, которая будет изу- чаться только на третьем курсе университета, но некоторые представ- ления о ней желательно иметь уже сейчас. Это будет не последова- тельное введение в квантовую механику, а рассмотрение ее на не- скольких примерах.        Еще в 19 веке были известны явления, которые не описывались  классической физикой — это спектры излучения атомов, спектр излу- чения нагретого тела. Было непонятно, как устроен атом, почему элек- трон не падает на ядро, почему у атома размер порядка  8 10-  см?       В 1990 г. М. Планк для объяснения спектра теплового излучения  ввел новую фундаментальную константу   — постоянную Планка. В  1905 году А. Эйнштейн объяснил явление фотоэффекта, предположив  существование квантов света (фотонов) с энергией w  , что было под- тверждено А. Комптоном в экспериментах по рассеянию рентгенов- ского излучения на электронах. В 1923 году Луи де Бройль высказал  идею, что по аналогии с фотоном, любая материальная частица обла- дает волновыми свойствами:           n = E/   и  2 /p l = p  ,                               (98.1)  где l  — длина волны Де Бройля, положив начало развитию волновой  механики.

Может показаться, что первый закон Ньютона вытекает из второго.  Действительно, если сила равна нулю, то ускорение тоже нулю и ско- рость постоянна. Однако, эта точка зрения неверна. Первый закон по- стулирует существование инерциальных систем отсчета, привязанных  к свободным телам.

Раздел  механики, изучающий причины движения тел, называется динамикой.  Существование в природе максимальной скорости движения коренным  образов влияет на законы динамики. Однако вспомним сначала основ- ные положения нерелятивистской динамики.  Еще древние интересовались законами движения, однако их взгля- ды, основанные в основном на созерцании и философствовании, были  далеки от действительности, даже приближенно. Так греческий фило- соф Аристотель (~384 до н. э.) считал, что для всякого движения (даже  с постоянной скоростью) нужно внешнее воздействие. Причина, по ко- торой катится шар, Аристотель называл силой, которая передается ша- ру из окружающей среды. Такие воззрения существовали очень долго.  Только в начале 17 века Галилей с помощью экспериментов ясно пока- зал, что скорость свободного тела сохраняется сама по себе, а сила свя- зана не со скоростью тела, а его ускорением. Своими экспериментами  он убедительно опроверг умозрительную метафизику Аристотеля и  заложил фундамент классической механики. Основные же законы ме- ханики сформулировал Ньютон (1687).   По современным воззрениям, законы механики Ньютона верны в  широкой области применимости. Однако при скоростях близких к ско- рости света нужно использовать механику Эйнштейна, а при малых  размерах и скоростях (mvr <  ) квантовую механику (см. Введение).     Выпишем, а затем рассмотрим законы Ньютона более детально.  Первый закон Ньютона.  Существуют такие системы отсчёта, относительно которых  материальная точка (тело), при отсутствии внешних воздействий,  сохраняет состояние покоя или равномерного прямолинейного движе- ния.

Прин- цип суперпозиции в достаточно сильных гравитационных полях не  выполняется.       Явления, связанные с гравитацией, описывает Общая Теория Отно- сительности (ОТО), созданная А. Эйнштейном (1916). Принцип отно- сительности был распространен на системы, находящиеся в гравитаци- онных полях. Ключом к решению задачи стал принцип эквивалентно- сти. Гравитационные поля по своему действию очень похожи на силы,  возникающие в неинерциальных (ускоренных) системах отсчета. В па- дающем лифте сила инерции и гравитационная сила компенсируются.  Законы физики в такой системе будут совпадать с законами в инерци- альных системах. Сидя в лифте нельзя сказать, какая часть силы вы- звана гравитацией, а какая ускорением лифта. Разница заключается  только в том, что силы инерции можно полностью исключить выбором  системы отсчета, а истинно гравитационные силы можно скомпенси- ровать силами инерции только в точке. Так в падающем лифте пробное  тело, помещенное в центре лифта, будет иметь нулевое ускорение от- носительно лифта, в верхней точке лифта сила тяжести немного мень- ше, поэтому тело будет ускоряться вверх, соответственно в нижней  точке вниз.

phys.pdf,ru,34,"§ 14. Максимальная скорость сигналов, постула- ты Эйнштейна  Постулат об абсолютности времени во всех системах отсчёта в  классической механике подразумевает бесконечную скорость распро- странения сигналов. Однако уже давно было известно, что даже свет  имеет конечную скорость около  3 1010 ⋅  см/сек (Рёмер, 1676 – затмения  спутников Юпитера; 1728 – звёздная абберация; Физо, 1849 – измере- ния в земных условиях). Ремер заметил, что моменты затмения спут- ников Юпитера нерегулярные и за полгода набегает задержка около 20  минут. Он сообразил, что это связано с тем, что за счет вращения Зем- ли вокруг Солнца расстояние до Юпитера меняется и эта задержка свя- зана с конечностью скорости света.      В конце XIX века, в связи с созданием электродинамики, возникли  проблемы, связанные с распространением света в пустоте. Пытались  ввести понятие эфира. Эфир представлялся некой средой, относитель- но которой тела движутся с различной скоростью. Скорость света от- носительно эфира постоянна, так что скорость света относительно на- блюдателя зависит от скорости наблюдателя, аналогично тому, как  распространяется звук в воздухе или волны на воде. Введение эфира  как среды – это введение выделенной системы отсчета, что нарушает  принцип относительности, заключающийся в эквивалентности всех  инерциальных систем отсчета. Гипотеза эфира не нашла подтвержде- ния в опытах Майкельсона-Морли (1881) (схема эксперимента описана  во многих учебниках).   Всё это побудило пересмотреть основные представления о про- странстве и времени. В результате была создана Теория относительно- сти (1905), называемая также частной или специальной Т.О., т.к. в ней  рассматриваются только инерциальные системы отсчёта.  В основу теории относительности были положены два постулата:    Принцип относительности. Законы природы имеют одинаковый  вид во всех инерциальных системах отсчёта.

Однако, за последние  10-15 лет в космологии сделаны потрясающие открытия, поступающие  данные настолько информативные, что есть надежда понять первые  мгновения жизни Вселенной.

Еще  25% - это какая-то невидимая форма материи, темная материя, это  какие-то частицы, способные концентрироваться там же где и обычная  материя. В галактиках темной материи в 5-6 раз больше, чем обычной.  Большую часть плотности Вселенной, примерно 70%, составляет во- обще нечто непонятное, вызывающее антигравитацию на больших  масштабах. За счет этого расширение Вселенной не замедляется, как  ожидалось, а наоборот, ускоряется. Эту субстанцию называют темной  энергией. Темная энергия ведет себя, так как будто это вакуум с нену- левой плотностью.

Они уже было надеялись поколотить Малфоя, но профессор МакГонагалл,  умевшая замечать беспорядки быстрее любого другого учителя, была тут как тут.       -- Что происходит?       -- Малфой взял мой Напоминатель, Профессор.

В три тридцать пополудни Гарри, Рон и остальные гриффиндорцы вышли по главной лестнице на  поляну на первый урок полетов. Был ясный ветреный день. Они спускались по наклонным лужайкам с  колышащейся травой, пока не добрались до небольшой полянки на другом конце территории, со  стороны Запретного Леса, деревья которого темнели вдалеке.       Слиферинцы уже были здесь, и на земле аккуратными рядами лежали двадцать метел. Гарри раз  слышал, как Фред и Джордж Уизли ругали школьные метлы, говоря, что те начинают вибрировать,  если взлетаешь слишком высоко, и к тому же забирают влево.       Пришла учительница, мадам Хутч. У ней были коротко стриженые седые волосы и желтые совиные  глаза.       -- Ну, чего вы ждете? -- гаркнула она. -- Каждый встает рядом с метлой. Поживее!       Гарри посмотрел на свою метлу. Она была старой, некоторые прутья были сломаны и торчали под  странными углами.       -- Протяните правую руку над метлой, -- скомандовала мадам Хутч, -- И скажите: ""Ап!""       -- АП! -- закричали все.       Метла Гарри сразу же вскочила ему в руку, но так повезло только некоторым. Метла Гермионы  Грейнджер только перевернулась на другой бок, а Невиллева вообще не шелохнулась. Гарри  подумал, что, может, метлы, как лошади, чувствуют, когда их боятся; в голосе Невилля слышалась  дрожь, ясно дающая понять, что он предпочел бы оставаться на твердой земле.       Мадам Хутч показала, как садиться на метлу верхом так, чтобы не соскальзывать с другого конца, и  прошлась вдоль ряда, поправляя постановку рук. Гарри и Рон были страшно рады услышать, как она  сказала Малфою, что он годами держал метлу неправильно.           -- Теперь по моему свистку вы сильно оттолкнетесь от земли, -- сказала мадам Хутч. -- Держите  метлы прямо, подымитесь на несколько футов и сразу возвращайтесь, слегка наклонившись вниз.

Гарри видел его перепуганное белое лицо, видел, как тот  посмотрел вниз, на удаляющуюся площадку, зажмурился, соскользнул с метлы и...       Бам -- раздался неприятный глухой стук, и Невилль, лицом вниз, кучкой упал на траву. Его метла  поднялась еще выше, и, лениво дрейфуя, уплыла за Запретный лес и скрылась из виду.       Мадам Хутч наклонилась над Невиллем. Ее лицо было так же бледно, как и его.       -- Сломано запястье, -- услышал Гарри ее шепот. -- Пошли, малыш, все в порядке, ты жив.       Она повернулась к остальным.       -- Всем стоять смирно, пока я отведу этого мальчика в госпитальное крыло! И не смейте  прикасаться к метлам, а то вылетите из школы быстрее, чем скажете слово ""Квиддич"". Пошли, милый.

Поднятый им Напоминатель заблестел на солнце.       -- Дай сюда, Малфой, -- тихо произнес Гарри. Все замолчали.       Малфой мерзко ухмыльнулся.       -- Полагаю, я положу его где-нибудь так, чтоб Лонгботтом потом забрал -- ну, например...  ",4302,2746,,
potter.pdf,ru,51,"На дереве?       -- Дай сюда, -- закричал Гарри, но Малфой вскочил на свою метлу и был таков. Он не врал, он мог  хорошо летать -- с высоты верхних ветвей дуба он прокричал:       -- Ну-ка, Поттер, отними!       Гарри взялся за метлу.       -- Нет! -- закричала Гермиона. -- Мадам Хутч велела нам не двигаться, нам всем попадет.       Гарри не обратил на нее внимания. Кровь стучала в висках. Он вскочил на метлу, сильно  оттолкнулся от земли и взмыл вверх, вверх, воздух свистел в ушах, мантия развивалась позади -- и в  мгновенном порыве счастья он осознал, что он нашел что-то, чему не надо учиться -- это легко, это  чудесно. Он чуть потянул метлу вверх, чтобы подняться повыше, и услыхал крики и визг девочек на  лужайке и восхищенное уханье Рона.       Он резко развернулся в воздухе навстречу Малфою. Тот выглядел обалдевшим.       -- Дай сюда, -- сказал Гарри. -- А то сброшу тебя с метлы!       -- Да неужели? -- ответил Малфой, натужно улыбаясь, но при этом явно нервничая.       Каким-то образом Гарри знал, что делать. Он пролетел вперед, а затем сильно сжал метлу обеими  руками, и устремился на Малфоя, как копье. Малфой еле успел увернуться в последний момент;  Гарри резко развернулся и снова рванулся вперед. Несколько человек зааплодировали.       -- Ну что, тут тебе не спрятаться за Крабба и Гойла, а, Малфой? -- крикнул Гарри.       Похоже, та же мысль беспокоила и Малфоя.       -- На, лови, если можешь! -- завопил он, швырнул стеклянный шарик высоко в воздух, а сам  опустился на площадку.       Гарри видел, будто в замедленной съемке, как шарик взлетел вверх и начал падать. Он подал  вперед, а затем направил метлу ручкой вниз -- в следующий момент он понесся в пике, догоняя шарик  -- в ушах свистел ветер и отдавались крики зрителей -- он вытянул руку -- и в футе от земли поймал,  как раз вовремя, чтобы успеть выровнять метлу, и мягко приземлился на траву с Напоминателем,  крепко сжатым в горсти.       -- ГАРРИ ПОТТЕР!       Его сердце забилось быстрее, чем когда он был в пике. К ним бежала Профессор МакГонагалл. Он  поднялся, трепеща.       -- Никогда -- за все время в Хогвартсе...       Профессор МакГонагал от потрясения утратила дар речи, и только очки яростно сверкали.        -- Как ты посмел -- мог же шею свернуть...       -- Он не виноват, Профессор...       -- Помолчите, мисс Патиль.       -- Но Малфой...       -- Достаточно, мистер Уизли. Поттер, следуйте за мной, немедленно.       Уходя, Гарри успел заметить торжествующее выражение на лицах Малфоя, Крабба и Гойла.  Оцепенев, плелся он за профессором Макгонагалл по замку. Он знал, что его исключат. Он хотел  сказать хоть что-нибудь в свою защиту, но голос не повиновался ему. Профессор МакГонагалл шла  вперед, не оборачиваясь; ему приходилось следовать за ней. Допрыгался. Даже двух недель не  продержался. Через десять минут ему придется собирать вещи. Интересно, что скажут Дарсли,  увидев его на пороге?       Вверх по ступеням, вверх по внутренней мраморной лестнице, а профессор МакГонагалл еще ни  слова ему не сказала. Она распахивала двери и неслась по коридорам, а Гарри трусил следом.  Может, она ведет его к Дамбльдору? Он подумал, что вот Хагрида исключили, но позволили остаться  егерем. Может, он станет помощником Хагрида. У него сжался желудок, когда он представил себе, как  Рон и остальные станут волшебниками, а он так и будет бродить по территории, таская сумку за  Хагридом.        Профессор МакГонагалл остановилась перед одним из классов. Она открыла дверь и заглянула  внутрь.       -- Простите, профессор Флитвик, можно забрать Вуда на минутку?       -- Вуд? -- озадаченно подумал Гарри. -- Что это -- может, трость для наказаний?       Но Вуд оказался вполне человеком, крупным парнем с пятого курса, который, удивленный, вышел  из класса.       -- Следуйте за мной, оба. -- Сказала Профессор МакГонагалл, и они зашагали по коридору. Вуд с  любопытством поглядывал на Гарри.       -- Сюда.       Профессор МакГонагалл указала на комнату, которая была пуста, если не считать Пивса,  выводящего на доске бранные слова.   ",4050,2602,,
potter.pdf,ru,30,"    Глава шестая    ПУТЕШЕСТВИЕ ОТ ПЛАТФОРМЫ   НОМЕР ДЕВЯТЬ И ТРИ ЧЕТВЕРТИ         Последний месяц, проведенный с семейством Дарсли, приятным назвать было трудно. Правда,  Дадли теперь так боялся Гарри, что даже старался не находиться с ним в одной комнате. Дядюшка же  Вернон с тетей Петунией не запирали его больше в чулане, не заставляли работать по дому и не  кричали на него -- они вообще с ним не разговаривали. Напуганные и разъяренные, они вели себя, как  будто Гарри вообще не существовало. Хотя это и было изменением к лучшему, но через некоторое  время стало действовать угнетающе.       Гарри предпочитал оставаться в своей комнате, в компании новообретенной совы. Он решил  назвать ее Гедвигой, именем, вычитанным из Истории Магии. Учебники вообще оказались очень  интересными. Гарри валялся на кровати, читая до поздней ночи, а Гедвига сновала в свое  удовольствие туда и сюда сквозь открытое окно. Им повезло, что тетя Петуния перестала врываться  по утрам со своим пылесосом, потому что Гедвига частенько притаскивала с собою дохлых мышей.  Каждый раз, перед сном  Гарри вычеркивал еще одно число на листке бумаги, пришпиленном к стене,  считая оставшиеся до первого сентября дни.       В последний день августа он решил, что пора бы поговорить с дядей и тетей насчет того, как  попасть завтра на вокзал Кингс Кросс. Гарри спустился в гостиную, где все семейство смотрело по  телевизору какую-то викторину. Он кашлянул, давая знать о себе. Дадли завопил и выскочил из  комнаты.       -- Э-э -- Дядя Вернон?       Дядя Вернон пробурчал что-то, изображая, что слушает.       -- Э-э -- Мне надо завтра быть на Кингс Кросс -- ехать в Хогвартс.       Дядя Вернон снова что-то буркнул.       -- Вы меня не подбросите?       Бурчанье. Гарри предположил, что оно означает ""да"".       -- Спасибо.       Он уже собирался подняться к себе, как вдруг дядя Вернон заговорил членораздельно:       -- Странный способ добираться до волшебной школы -- на поезде. Что, все летающие ковры  попродырявились?       Гарри ничего не ответил.       -- Где хоть эта школа?       -- Не знаю, -- сказал Гарри, похоже, сам впервые осознав это. Он вытащил из кармана билет,  полученный от Хагрида.       -- Мой поезд уходит с платформы номер девять и три четверти в одиннадцать часов, -- прочел он.        Дядя с тетей выпучили на него глаза.        -- С какой такой платформы?        -- Девять и три четверти.        -- Не болтай чепухи, -- сказал дядя Вернон. -- Нет такой платформы девять и три четверти.       -- Так написано в билете.       -- Чушь собачья. -- сказал дядя Вернон.  -- Все они там просто сумасшедшие. Сам увидишь.  Подожди только. Ладно, мы отвезем тебя на Кингс Кросс. Мы все равно собирались завтра в Лондон,  а то бы я не стал с тобой возиться.       -- А зачем вам в Лондон? -- спросил Гарри, стараясь поддержать дружескую беседу.       -- Везем Дадли в больницу, -- проворчал дядя Вернон. -- Нужно избавить его от этого мерзкого  хвоста до начала занятий в Смелтингсе.             На следующий день Гарри проснулся в пять утра и был слишком возбужден, чтобы снова заснуть.  Он встал и натянул джинсы, потому что ехать на станцию в мантии волшебника ему не хотелось --  лучше переодеться в поезде. Он еще раз сверился с хогвартским списком, чтобы убедиться, что взял  все неоходимое, поглядел, надежно ли заперта Гедвига в своей клетке, а потом стал мерить шагами  комнату, ожидая, пока встанут Дарсли. Двумя часами позже его огромный тяжелый сундук был  наконец загружен в машину, тетя Петуния уломала Дадли сесть рядом с Гарри на заднее сиденье, и  они тронулись.  ",3579,2355,,
potter.pdf,ru,21,"     Гарри вскочил на ноги. Счастье распирало его изнутри, словно воздушный шар. Он подбежал к  окну и распахнул его. Сова влетела внутрь и бросила газету прямо на Хагрида, который продолжал  спать. Затем сова спикировала на пол и атаковала пальто Хагрида.       -- Не надо, перестань.       Гарри пытался отогнать сову, но та яростно щелкнула на него клювом и продолжала свирепо драть  пальто.       -- Хагрид, -- позвал Гарри громко. -- Тут сова...       -- Заплати ей, -- пробурчал Хагрид с дивана.       -- Что?       -- Она хочет платы за доставку газеты. Глянь в карманах.       Казалось, пальто Хагрида состоит только из карманов -- связки ключей, мотки веревки, железные  шарики, мятные подушечки, пакетики чая... Наконец Гарри обнаружил горсть странного вида монет.       -- Дай ей пять кнутсов, -- сонно произнес Хагрид.       -- Кнутсов?       -- Маленьких медных.       Гарри отсчитал пять мелких медных монеток, и сова протянула ему лапу с привязанным к ней  кожаным мешочком, чтобы он мог положить туда деньги. Затем сова выпорхнула в открытое окно.        Хагрид громко зевнул и сел, потягиваясь.       -- Давай шевелись, Гарри, нынче куча дел, надо ехать в Лондон и покупать тебе все для школы.        Гарри вертел в руках волшебные деньги, разглядывая их. Ему вдруг пришла в голову мысль, от  которой счастливый воздушный шарик у него внутри слегка сдулся.       -- Да...  Хагрид?       -- Мм? -- промычал Хагрид, надевая свои громадные ботинки.       -- У меня нет денег -- ты же слышал, что сказал дядя Вернон прошлой ночью -- что он не будет  платить за мое обучение магии.       -- Да не волнуйся ты об этом, -- сказал Хагрид, потягиваясь и почесывая голову. -- Думаешь, твои  родители ничего тебе не оставили?       -- Но если их дом был разрушен...       -- Они ж не хранили золото дома, парень! Мы сперва пойдем к Гринготтам. Это банк для  волшебников. Возьми сардельку, она и холодная хороша -- и я не отказался бы от куска твоего  именинного торта.       -- У волшебников есть банки?       -- Один банк. Гринготт. Под управлением гоблинов.       -- Гоблинов?       -- Ну да -- надо быть психом, чтобы пытаться его ограбить. Я тебе точно говорю. Никогда не  связывайся с гоблинами, Гарри. Если ты хочешь что-нибудь спрятать, то Гринготты -- надежнейшее  место в мире. Ну, кроме, может, Хогвартса. Я, вообще-то, так и так собирался зайти к Гринготтам.  Дамбльдор просил. По делам Хогвартса. -- Хагрид гордо выпятил грудь. -- Он доверяет мне важные  вещи. Тебя забрать, или там у Гринготтов что-то, -- знает, что может на меня положиться.       -- Ну, собрался? Поехали.       Гарри последовал за Хагридом на скалу. Небо было ясным, и море блестело в солнечных лучах.  Лодка, нанятая дядей Верноном, была еще здесь, полная воды после шторма.        -- Как ты сюда попал? -- спросил Гарри, озираясь в поисках другой лодки.        -- Прилетел, -- ответил Хагрид.       -- Прилетел?       -- Ну да. Но назад мы поплывем. Счас, раз ты со мной, мне не следует колдовать.       Они устроились в лодке. Гарри смотрел на Хагрида во все глаза, представляя его летящим.       -- Хотя грести глупо, -- сказал Хагрид, покосившись на Гарри. -- Если я... ну... слегка ускорю это  дело, ты не проболтаешься об этом в Хогвартсе?       -- Конечно, нет, -- сказал Гарри, стремясь увидеть побольше магии. Хагрид снова вытащил свой  розовый зонтик, дважды коснулся им борта лодки, и она прямо-таки рванула к берегу.       -- Почему надо быть сумасшедшим, чтобы пытаться ограбить Гринготтов? -- спросил Гарри.       -- Чары... Заклятья, -- ответил Хагрид, разворачивая одновременно газету. -- Говорят, что особо  секретные сейфы охраняют драконы. А потом еще нужно найти выход -- Гринготт занимает тысячи  миль под Лондоном. Глубоко под метро. С голоду подохнешь, пока выйдешь оттуда, даже если и  сумеешь стянуть хоть что-нибудь.       Гарри сидел, обдумывая услышанное, пока Хагрид читал газету, ""Ежедневный Пророк"". От  дядюшки Вернона Гарри усвоил, что в это время людей лучше не трогать, но это было так трудно, у  него в жизни не было столько вопросов.  ",4062,2637,,
potter.pdf,ru,49,"     Гарри вспомнил, как Рон рассказывал ему в поезде про взлом у Гринготтов, но Рон не называл  дату.        -- Хагрид! -- сказал Гарри. -- Гринготт взломали в мой день рождения! Это могло быть как раз тогда,  когда мы были там!        На этот раз никаких сомнений не было -- Хагрид определенно избегал встречаться с Гарри  глазами. Он буркнул что-то и предложил им еще каменного кекса. Гарри снова перечел заметку.       ""Содержимое сейфа было изъято ранее в тот же день"". Хагрид изъял содержимое семьсот  тринадцатого сейфа, если это можно назвать изъятием -- забрал тот маленький невзрачный сверток.  Может быть, воры искали именно его?       Когда Гарри и Рон возвращались в замок к обеду, их карманы были набиты каменными кексами, от  которых они из вежливости не смогли отказаться. Гарри думал, что ни один из его уроков не дал ему  столько поводов к размышлению, сколько это чаепитие у Хагрида. Забрал ли Хагрид сверток как раз  вовремя? И где он теперь? И знает ли Хагрид о Снэйпе что-то такое, чего не хочет рассказывать  Гарри?             Глава девятая     ПОЛНОЧНАЯ ДУЭЛЬ           До встречи с Драко Малфоем Гарри никогда бы не поверил, что существует мальчик гаже Дадли.  До сих пор у Гриффиндора со Слиферином был только один общий урок, так что они не часто  пересекались с Малфоем. По крайней мере, до тех пор, пока не заметили висевшее в гостиной  Гриффиндора объявление, заставившее всех охнуть. Уроки управления метлой начинаются в четверг  -- и Гриффиндор со Слиферином занимаются вместе.       -- Ясное дело, -- заметил Гарри мрачно. -- Всегда об этом мечтал. Выставить себя перед Малфоем  полным идиотом на метле.       Он больше всех хотел научиться летать.       -- Еще неизвестно, кто окажется идиотом, -- резонно заметил Рон. -- Малфой, конечно, болтает  направо и налево, какой он мастер Квиддича, но спорим, это только треп.        Малфой-таки болтал о полетах. Он громко сожалел о том, что первокурсников не допускают в  команду по Квиддичу и излагал длинные хвастливые истории, которые все, как одна кончались тем,  как он счастливо избежал столкновения с магглами на вертолете. Хотя он был не один такой: по  словам Симуса Финнегана, он провел большую часть своего детства, рассекая по окрестностям на  метле. Даже Рон мог рассказать желающему послушать, как он однажды врезался в планер на старой  метле Чарли. Все из волшебных семей, не переставая, говорили о Квиддиче. Рон страшно поспорил о  футболе с Дином Томасом из их спальни. Рон отказывался понять, что может быть привлекательного  в игре, где никто не летает, а мяч только один. Гарри как-то застал Рона, тычущего пальцем в  футбольный плакат Дина, чтобы заставить игроков двигаться.       Невилль в жизни не сидел на метле, бабушка его к ней и близко не подпускала. Гарри в душе  считал, что она была права, потому что даже когда Невилль стоял двумя ногами на земле, с ним  постоянно приключались различные несчастья.        Гермиона Грейнджер нервничала так же, как Невилль. Прочтя книжку и выучив ее наизусть, нельзя  было научиться летать -- хотя она пыталась. За завтраком в четверг она доняла всех цитатами из  книжки Квиддич сквозь века, которую отыскала в библиотеке. Невилль отчаянно ловил каждое ее  слово, надеясь, что это хоть как-то сможет помочь впоследствии, но все остальные были страшно  рады, когда лекция Гермионы была прервана прибытием почты.       Гарри ни разу не пришло ни одного письма, кроме записки Хагрида, и Малфой, конечно же, не  преминул это отметить. Сам-то он постоянно получал из дома пакеты со сластями, которые радостно  вскрывались за столом Слиферина.        Сова-сипуха принесла Невиллю маленькую посылку от бабушки. Он в восторге раскрыл ее и  обнаружил стеклянный шарик величиной с грецкий орех, который был заполнен белым дымом.        -- Это Напоминатель! -- объяснил Невилль. -- Ба знает, что я все забываю -- а эта штука сообщает  тебе, что ты о чем-то забыл. Смотрите, держишь ее вот так, и она становится красной -- ой... -- Он  сник, потому что Напоминатель внезапно налился алым -- ... если ты что-то позабыл...  ",4057,2579,,
potter.pdf,ru,37,"     -- Ничего, и потому это такая сенсация. Их не поймали. Папа говорит, похоже, тут работал  могущественный Темный Маг, но, кажется, ничего не пропало, это-то и странно. Конечно, когда такое  происходит, все пугаются до смерти, за этим ведь может стоять Сам-Знаешь-Кто.       Гарри переварил сообщение. Похоже, что ему становилось страшновато каждый раз, когда  упоминался Сам-Знаешь-Кто. Наверное, это было частью вхождения в мир волшебников, но ему  лично было бы гораздо удобнее произносить: ""Волдеморт"" и при этом не дергаться.      --  Тебе какая команда по Квиддичу нравится? -- спросил Рон.      -- Э-э -- я ни одной не знаю, -- признался Гарри.      -- Чего? -- Рон просто обалдел. -- Ты что, это же лучшая в мире игра, -- и он ринулся объяснять все  про четыре мяча и про позиции семи игроков, описывать знаменитые матчи, на которых он бывал с  братьями и рассказывать про метлу, которую бы купил, будь у него деньги. Он как раз посвящал Гарри  с тончайшие нюансы игры, когда дверь купе в который раз отодвинулась, но на сей раз это не был ни  Невилль-Без-Жабы, ни Гермиона Грейнжер.        Вошли трое и Гарри сразу же узнал того, что в середине: это был бледный мальчик из одежного  магазина Мадам Малкин. Он смотрел на Гарри с гораздо большим интересом, чем тогда, в  Диагональном проулке.        -- Это правда? -- спросил он. -- Весь поезд только и говориит, что Гарри Поттер в этом купе. Это ты,  что ли?       -- Да, -- ответил Гарри. Он рассматривал двух других. Оба были здоровенными и выглядели жутко  злобными. Стоя по бокам бледного мальчика, они казались его телохранителями.       -- Ах да, это Крабб, а это Гойл, -- небрежно бросил бледный мальчик, поймав взгляд Гарри. -- А  меня зовут Малфой, Драко Малфой.       Рон поперхнулся, как будто бы подавил смешок. Драко Малфой взглянул на него.       -- Похоже, мое имя тебя рассмешило? Твое-то вообще можно не спрашивать. Отец говорил мне,  что у всех Уизли рыжие волосы, веснушки и больше детей, чем они могут себе позволить.       Он снова повернулся к Гарри.       -- Ты скоро узнаешь, Поттер, что одни семьи волшебников гораздо лучше других.  Полагаю, ты не захочешь дружить со второсортными? Я мог бы помочь тебе разобраться.       Он протянул руку для пожатия, но Гарри не принял ее.       -- Благодарю, но мне кажется, я сам разберусь, кто какого сорта, -- холодно сказал он.       Драко Малфой не покраснел, но на его бледных щеках появился легкий розоватый оттенок.       -- Я бы на твоем месте поостерегся, Поттер, -- медленно произнес он. -- Если ты не станешь  повежливей, кончишь так же, как твои родители. Они тоже  не понимали своей выгоды. Пообщаешься  с оборванцами вроде Уизли и этого Хагрида и сам таким же станешь.       Гарри и Рон поднялись одновременно. Лицо Рона стало одного цвета с волосами.       -- Ну-ка повтори, -- сказал он.       -- О, вы, кажется, собираетесь с нами драться? -- ухмыльнулся Малфой.       -- Если вы раньше не уберетесь, -- сказал Гарри храбро, но чувствовал он себя не так уж уверенно,  потому что Крабб и Гойл были гораздо больше что его, что Рона.       -- Но мы не собираемся уходить, не правда ли, мальчики? Мы съели все свое, а у вас, кажется, что- то осталось.       Гойл потянулся за роновой Шоколадной Лягушкой, Рон рванулся вперед, но не успел даже  дотронуться до Гойла, как тот издал жуткий вопль.       Крыса Скабберс болтался у него на пальце, вонзив маленькие острые зубки глубоко в костяшку --  Крабб и Малфой попятились, а Гойл, подвывая, вращал рукой, пытаясь стряхнуть Скабберса, пока тот  в конце концов не отлетел, ударившись об оконное стекло. Троица сразу исчезла. Может быть, они  опасались, что среди сластей прячутся другие крысы, а может, они услышали шаги, потому что  секундой позже вошла Гермиона Грейнджер.       -- Что тут у вас происходит? -- спросила она, глядя на сласти, покрывающие пол, и Рона,  подымающего Скабберса за хвост.       -- Думаю, он в нокауте, -- сказал Рон Гарри. Он вгляделся в Скабберся попристальней. --- Нет,  глазам не верю -- он опять спит.       И так оно и было.       -- Ты встречал Малфоя раньше?       Гарри рассказал про встречу в Диагональном проулке.       -- Наслышан я про его семейку, -- мрачно сказал Рон. -- Они были первыми, кто вернулся на нашу  сторону, когда Сам-Знаешь-Кто исчез. Говорили при этом, что их-де очаровали. Папа в это не верит.  Он говорит, что отец Малфоя не нуждается в дополнительном поводе для перехода на сторону  Темных Сил. -- он повернулся к Гермионе: -- Тебе тут что-нибудь нужно?  ",4501,2824,,
potter.pdf,ru,15,"     Провиант дяди Вернона оказался при ближайшем рассмотрении пакетом чипсов на каждого и  четырьмя бананами. Он попытался развести огонь, но пакеты только задымились и скукожились.       -- Пусть теперь попробуют добраться до нас со своими письмами, -- сказал дядюшка бодро.       Он был в прекрасном настроении. Он явно считал, что ни у кого нет шансов доставить почту сюда  сквозь шторм. Гарри в душе согласился с ним, и это не прибавило ему радости.        Ночью вокруг разыгрался обещанный шторм. Брызги от волн стекали, журча, по стенам хижины, а  яростный ветер стучал в грязные окна. Тетя Петуния нашла в соседней комнате несколько  заплесневелых одеял, и соорудила из них постель для Дадли на погрызанном мышами диванчике.  Они с дядей Верноном ушли спать на продавленной кровати в соседней комнате, предоставив Гарри  самому выбирать себе самый уютный кусочек пола, где он и свернулся под наиболее тонким и  драным из одеял.           В течение ночи шторм больше и больше ужесточался. Гарри не мог заснуть. Он дрожал и  вертелся с боку на бок, стараясь устроиться поудобнее, в желудке бурчало от голода. Храп Дадли  теперь заглушали грозовые раскаты, начавшиеся около полуночи. Светящийся циферблат часов на  жирном запястье Дадли, свисающем с края дивана, показывал Гарри, что ему будет одиннадцать  через десять минут. Он лежал и смотрел, как его день рождения подступает все ближе, думая,  вспомнят ли Дарсли вообще о его дне рождения, размышляя, где может сейчас быть отправитель  писем.       Осталось пять минут. Гарри услышал, как что-то скрипнуло снаружи. Он надеялся, что это не  крыша падает им на голову, хотя, может, упади она, стало бы потеплее. Четыре минуты. Может, дом  на Бузинном проезде уже так переполнился письмами, что ему удастся стянуть хоть одно, когда они  вернутся.        Осталось три минуты. Это море так сильно плещет о скалу?  И что это (две минуты) за странное  потрескивание? Скала рушится в море?       Одна минута, и ему исполнится одиннадцать. Тридцать секунд... Двадцать... Десять -- девять --  может, разбудить Дадли, просто чтобы позлить его -- три -- две -- одна --       БУМ.       Лачуга вся содрогнулась, Гарри подскочил и сел, глядя на дверь. Кто-то стучался снаружи, чтобы  войти.                        Глава четвертая     ХРАНИТЕЛЬ КЛЮЧЕЙ           БУМ. Стук повторился. Дадли дернулся, просыпаясь.       -- Где пушка? -- глупо спросил он.       Сзади раздался треск, и в комнату ворвался дядя Вернон. В руках у него была винтовка -- вот,  значит, что было в том длинном, тонком свертке.       -- Кто здесь? -- заорал он. -- Предупреждаю -- я вооружен!       Пауза. А затем --       ХРЯСТЬ!       В дверь ударили с такой силой, что она слетела с петель и с оглушительным грохотом хлопнулась  на пол.        В дверном проеме стоял гигантский человек. Его лица совершенно не было видно из-за копны  длинных спутанных волос и дикой косматой бороды, но глаза его поблескивали оттуда, словно два  черных жука.       Великан проскользнул в хижину, задев головой потолок. Он нагнулся, поднял упавшую дверь и с  легкостью вставил ее на место. Шум шторма, доносившийся снаружи, слегка попритих. Он  повернулся, и оглядел их всех.       -- Может, заварим чайку? Не так-то просто было досюда добраться...       Он шагнул к дивану, где сидел остолбеневший от страха Дадли.       -- Двинься, жирный бурдюк, -- сказал незнакомец.       Дадли заверещал и побежал прятаться за спину матери, которая сама испуганно жалась к дяде  Вернону.      -- Так это ты, Гарри, -- произнес великан.  ",3529,2351,,
potter.pdf,ru,43,"     -- Итак -- новые Гриффиндорцы! Надеюсь, вы собираетесь помочь нам выиграть Состязание домов  в этом году? Гриффиндор никогда не оставался столько времени без Кубка. Слиферин выигрывает  его шесть лет подряд! Кровавый Барон стал совершенно невыносим -- это привидение Слиферина.        Гарри посмотрел на стол Слиферина и увидел сидящее там жуткий призрак, с бессмысленными  выпученными глазами, изможденным лицом и мантией, залитой серебряной кровью. Он сидел рядом  с Малфоем, и, как Гарри отметил не без удовольствия, последний был явно не в восторге от  расположения за столом.       -- Как его угораздило так испачкаться в крови? -- с большим интересом спросил Симус.       -- Я никогда не спрашивал, -- деликатно ответил Почти Безголовый Ник.       Когда все съели, сколько могли, оставшаяся пища исчезла с тарелок, оставив их в первозданной  чистоте. Моментом позже появился десерт. Пачки мороженого на любой возможный вкус, яблочные  пироги, трехслойные торты, шоколадные эклеры и пончики с джемом, трюфели, клубника, желе,  рисовый пудинг...       Пока Гарри расправлялся с трехслойным тортом, разговор зашел о семьях.       -- Я половинка, -- рассказывал Симус. -- Мой отец полный маггл. Мама скрывала, что она ведьма,  пока они не поженились. Он пережил неприятное потрясение.       Все засмеялись.       -- А ты, Невилль? -- спросил Рон.       -- Ну, меня вырастила бабушка, она-то колдунья. -- ответил Невилль, -- но вся семья считала, что я  безнадежный маггл. Прадедушка Алджи все пытался застать меня врасплох и отыскать во мне хоть  каплю магических способностей -- даже однажды столкнул меня с Блэкпулльского пирса. Я тогда чуть  не утонул, но ничего не получалось, пока мне не исполнилось восемь. Прадедушка Алджи зашел к  нам выпить чаю, и вывесил меня за ногу из окна второго этажа, но тут двоюродная бабушка Антея  предложила ему меренгу, и он меня упустил. Но я спружинил и отскочил обратно -- до самого сада и  на дорогу. Они все так обрадовались. Бабушка плакала от счастья. И вы бы видели их лица, когда я  поступил сюда -- они опасались, что, может, во мне все-таки недостаточно магии для Хогвартса.  Прадедушка Алджи был так рад, что купил мне жабу.       С другой стороны от Гарри Перси Уизли и Гермиона обсуждали уроки (... ""Я так надеюсь, что уроки  начнутся немедленно, мне особенно нравится Трансфигурация, это так здорово, превращать что-то во  что-нибудь другое, конечно, это наверное, очень сложно, -- Вы начнете с простых вещей, ну там  спички в иголки и прочее в таком духе""...).       Гарри, чувствуя себя сытым и сонным, снова взглянул на Высший Стол. Хагрид пил из своего  кубка. Профессор МакГонагалл беседовала с профессором Дамбльдором. Профессор Квиррелл в  своем дурацком тюрбане разговаривал с учителем, у которого были черные волосы с проседью,  крючковатый нос и землистая кожа.        Это произошло внезапно. Крючконосый учитель взглянул поверх тюрбана Квиррелла прямо Гарри  в глаза -- и острая, жгучая боль пронизала лоб Гарри на месте шрама.        -- Ой! -- Гарри хлопнул ладонью по лбу.       -- Что такое? -- спросил Перси.       -- Н-ничего.       Боль прошла так же быстро, как возникла. Хуже было с чувством, которое Гарри прочел в глазах   учителя -- что Гарри ему совсем не нравится.        -- Кто это разговаривает с профессором Квирреллом? -- спросил он у Перси.       -- А, ты уже знаешь Квиррелла? Неудивительно, что он выглядит так нервозно, это профессор  Снэйп. Он преподает Зелья, но он недоволен этим. Всем известно, что он хотел получить место  Квиррелла. Чертовски много знает про Темные Силы, этот Снэйп.        Гарри продолжал поглядывать на Снэйпа, но тот больше не смотрел на него.       Наконец десерт исчез и профессор Дамбльдор снова поднялся. Весь зал почтительно затих.          -- Кхм -- Еще несколько слов, теперь, когда вы все накормлены и напоены. У меня есть несколько  объявлений в связи с началом нового учебного года.         -- Первокурсникам следует знать, что лес на школьном участке является запретным для всех  учеников. И некоторым ученикам постарше тоже неплохо вспомнить об этом.         Светящиеся глаза Дамбльдора вспыхнули в сторону близнецов Уизли.        -- Я также попросил мистера Филча, коменданта, напомнить вам, что между уроками в коридорах  не разрешается пользоваться магией.        -- Тренировки по Квиддичу начнутся со второй недели занятий. Тех, кто заинтересован в игре за  свой дом, просим обращаться к мадам Хутч.       -- И наконец я должен сказать вам, что в этом году коридор третьего этажа в правом крыле закрыт  для доступа всем, под угрозой мучительной смерти.   ",4589,2840,,
potter.pdf,ru,53,"     -- Что такое волшебная дуэль? -- спросил Гарри. -- И что значит секундант?       -- Ну, секундант нужен, чтобы продолжить, если ты погибнешь, -- небрежно пояснил Рон, глядя  наконец на свой остывший пудинг. Заметив выражение лица Гарри, он быстро добавил:       -- Но погибают только в настоящих дуэлях, в смысле, настоящие маги. Максимум, что сможете  сделать вы с Малфоем, это пустить искры друг в друга. Никто из вас не знает достаточно магии,  чтобы навредить по-настоящему. Готов поклясться, он думал, ты испугаешься и откажешься.        -- А если я взмахну палочкой, а ничего не случится?        -- Бросишь ее и дашь ему в нос, -- предложил Рон.       -- Простите.       Они обернулись. Это была Гермиона Грейнджер.        -- Может человек спокойно поесть в этом доме? -- возмутился Рон.       Не обращая на него внимания, Гермиона заговорила с Гарри.        -- Я совершенно случайно услышала твой разговор с Малфоем...       -- Клянусь, что не случайно, -- пробурчал Рон.       -- ... Вы не должны пользоваться волшебными палочками в школе ночью, подумайте о баллах,  которые снимут с Гриффиндора, если вас поймают, а вас поймают обязательно. Это абсолютно  эгоистично и безответственно с вашей стороны.       -- И это абсолютно не твое дело, -- ответил Гарри.       -- Счастливо оставаться, -- добавил Рон.           И все равно, трудно назвать это достойным завершением дня, думал Гарри, прислушиваясь, как  засыпают Дин и Симус (Невилль до сих пор не вернулся из госпитального крыла). Рон провел остаток  вечера, давая ему советы типа: ""если он попытается поразить тебя проклятьем, постарайся  пригнуться, потому что я не помню, как их блокируют"". Вероятность того, что их застукают Филч или  Миссис Норрис, была очень велика, и Гарри казалось, что он искушает судьбу, нарушая правила  школьного распорядка второй раз за день. С другой стороны, перед глазами постоянно всплывало  ухмыляющееся лицо Малфоя -- и жаль было упускать такой шанс оказаться с ним лицом к лицу и  победить его.        -- Половина одиннадцатого, -- пробормотал Рон. -- Нам пора.       Они натянули халаты, взяли палочки, прокрались через спальню и спустились по винтовой  лестнице в гостиную Гриффиндора. Несколько углей все еще тлело в камине, и кресла казались  горбатыми сгустками темноты. Они почти добрались до выхода за портретом, когда из ближнего  кресла раздался голос:       -- Я не могу поверить, Гарри, что ты действительно собираешься это сделать.       Зажглась лампа. Это была Гермиона Грейнджер, облаченная в негодование и розовый халат.        -- Ты! -- сказал Рон разъяренно. -- Иди спать!       -- Я чуть не рассказала твоему брату, -- ругалась Гермиона. -- Перси, он Префект, он бы положил  конец этому безобразию.        Гарри не представлял, что кто-то может быть таким докучливым.         -- Пошли, -- сказал Рон. Он отстранил портрет толстой дамы и выбрался наружу.         Гермиона явно не собиралась так легко сдаваться. Она полезла за Роном через дыру, шипя на  них, как разъяренная гусыня.         -- Вы не думаете о Гриффиндоре, вы думаете только о себе, а я не хочу, чтобы Слиферин  выиграл Кубок, из-за вас мы потеряем все очки, которые мне начислила профессор МакГонагалл за  знание Заклинаний Обмена.        -- Уходи.       -- Хорошо, но я вас предупредила, и вы еще вспомните мои слова завтра в поезде на пути домой,  вы такие...       Но какие они, они так и не узнали. Гермиона повернулась к портрету толстой дамы, чтобы  вернуться обратно, и обнаружила, что портрет пуст. Толстая дама ушла к кому-то в гости, и вход в  Гриффиндор оказался запертым.        -- И что мне теперь делать? -- пронзительным голосом спросила она.       -- Твои проблемы, -- ответил Рон. -- Нам надо идти, а то мы опоздаем.       Они не успели дойти до конца коридора, как Гермиона догнала их.        -- Я иду с вами, -- сказала она.       -- Не идешь.       -- Вы что считаете, я буду торчать здесь и ждать,пока меня поймает Филч? Если он найдет нас  втроем, я скажу ему правду, что я старалась вас остановить, и вы это подтвердите.  ",4036,2511,,
potter.pdf,ru,38,"     -- Вы бы лучше поторопились и одели бы форму, я только что ходила к машинисту, и он говорит,  что мы уже подъезжаем. Уж не дрались ли вы тут? Попадете в неприятности еще до того, как мы  приедем на место!       -- Это Скабберс дрался, а не мы, -- скривился на нее Рон. -- Не выйдешь ли ты, пока мы будем  переодеваться?       -- Хорошо, я и пришла-то только потому, что все снаружи ведут себя по-детски, носятся взад и  вперед по коридорам, -- высокомерно сказала Гермиона. -- И между прочим, у тебя грязь на носу, тебе  это известно?        Рон мрачно наблюдал за ее уходом. Гарри поглядел в окно. Темнело. Он различал горы и леса  под темно-лиловым небом. Похоже, поезд стал ехать медленнее.       Они с Роном сняли свои куртки и натянули длинные черные мантии. Ронова была ему коротковата,  из-под нее виднелись спортивные штаны.        По поезду разнесся голос: ""Мы прибываем в Хогвартс через пять минут. Пожалуйста, оставьте  багаж в поезде, он будет доставлен в школу отдельно.""       У Гарри на нервной почве заурчало в животе, а Рон побледнел под своими веснушками. Они  запихали в карманы остатки сластей и присоединились к толпе, переполняющей  коридор.       Поезд замедлил ход и наконец остановился. Люди проталкивались через двери наружу, на  крошечную темную платформу. Гарри поежился от холодного ночного воздуха. Появилась лампа, она  раскачивалась над головами, и Гарри услышал знакомый голос:       -- Первый год! Первый год, ко мне! Гарри, как дела?       Большое заросшее лицо Хагрида улыбалось над морем голов.       -- Давай, все за мной -- есть еще первый год? Смотри под ноги! Первый год, за мной!       Поскальзываясь и спотыкаясь, они шли за Хагридом по узенькой крутой тропе. С обеих сторон  было очень темно, и Гарри предположил, что здесь, наверное, растут густые деревья. Никто особо не  разговаривал. Невилль, мальчик, вечно теряющий жабу, пару раз шмыгнул носом.       -- Щас впервые увидите Хогвартс, -- кинул Хагрид через плечо. -- Прям за этим поворотом.       Раздалось всеобщее: ""Ах!""       Узенькая тропа вдруг вышла на берег большого черного озера. На противоположном берегу, на  вершине горы, светясь окнами на фоне звездного неба, расположился замок со множеством башен и  башенок.       -- Не боле четырех в лодку! -- возгласил Хагрид, указывая на флотилию маленьких лодочек,  качающихся на воде около берега. Следом за Гарри и Роном в лодку сели Невилль и Гермиона.       -- Все тут? -- прокричал Хагрид, занимая один целую лодку. -- Ну, хорошо. ВПЕРЕД!       И маленькие лодочки двинулись одновременно, скользя по озеру, гладкому, как стекло. Все  хранили молчание, глядя на величавый замок впереди. По мере приближения к утесу, он вырастал  все больше и больше, нависая над ними.       -- Пригнись! -- проорал Хагрид, как только первые лодки достигли обрыва; все наклонили головы и  лодочки пронесли их сквозь густую завесь плюща, прикрывавшую широкую расщелину в стене утеса.       Они проплыли сквозь темный туннель, который, казалось, вел под самый замок, пока не достигли  подземной пристани, где они выкарабкались на берег, покрытый гравием и галькой.       -- Эй, ты! Твоя жаба? -- сказал Хагрид, который проверял лодки по мере того, как они пустели.       -- Тревор! -- блаженно завопил Невилль, простирая к жабе руки. Затем все долго взбирались по  проходу в скале, следуя за лампой Хагрида, и наконец выбрались на пышную влажную траву прямо у  подножия замка.       Они поднялись по каменным ступеням и столпились возле массивной дубовой входной двери.       -- Все здесь? Эй, там, жаба еще с тобой?       Гигантским кулаком Хагрид трижды постучал в дверь замка.                                     Глава седьмая    ШЛЯПА ВЫБОРА           Дверь сразу же распахнулась. На пороге стояла высокая черноволосая колдунья в изумрудно- зеленой мантии. Ее лицо было очень строгим, и первой мыслью Гарри было, что  такую лучше не  сердить.   ",3891,2536,,
potter.pdf,ru,55,"     -- Шныряете по ночам, первачки? Ай-яй-яй. Кто много шлялся, тот и попался.       -- Не попадемся, если ты нас не выдашь, Пивс, пожалуйста...       -- Должен рассказать Филчу. Должен. -- произнес Пивс примерным голосом, но глазки его хитро  поблескивали. -- Для вашей же пользы.       -- Уйди с дороги, -- гаркнул Рон, замахнувшись на Пивса. Это было большой ошибкой.       -- УЧАЩИЕСЯ  ВНЕ СПАЛЬНИ! -- заголосил Пивс. -- УЧАЩИЕСЯ  ВНЕ СПАЛЬНИ, В КОРИДОРЕ  ЧАР!       Проскользнув под Пивсом, они понеслись, спасая свою шкуру, до самого конца коридора, и  врезались в дверь. Дверь была заперта.       -- Все, -- простонал Рон, беспомощно дергая дверь. -- Нам конец! Попались.       Они слышали шаги. Филч мчался с максимальной скоростью на крики Пивса.       -- Ой, отойдите, -- рявкнула Гермиона. Схватив палочку Гарри, она постучала по замку и  прошептала: ""Алохомора!""       Замок щелкнул и дверь открылась. Они пропихнулись внутрь, захлопнули ее за собой, и Гарри  припал к ней ухом, прислушиваясь.       -- Куда они пошли, Пивс? -- спрашивал Филч. -- Говори, быстро.       -- Скажи: ""Пожалуйста"".       -- Не серди меня, Пивс. Куда они девались?       -- Не скажу ничего, пока не скажешь ""Пожалуйста"", -- говорил Пивс своим противным голоском  нараспев.       -- Ладно -- пожалуйста.       -- НИЧЕГО! Ха-ха! Говорил, не скажу ""Ничего"", пока не скажешь ""Пожалуйста"". -- Было слышно, как  Пивс улетает, а Филч бранится ему вслед.       -- Он думает, что дверь заперта, прошептал Гарри. -- Похоже, все обойдется. Ну что еще, Невилль!  -- потому что Невилль всю последнюю минуту дергал его за рукав халата. -- Что?       Гарри обернулся, и сразу четко увидел -- что. На секунду ему показалось, что это страшный сон --   учитывая все предыдущее, это было уж слишком.       Они находились не в комнате, как ему казалось. Они были в коридоре. В запретном коридоре на  третьем этаже. И теперь было понятно, почему он запретный.        Они смотрели прямо в глаза чудовищного пса, пса, занимавшего все пространство между полом и  потолком. У зверя было три головы. Три пары злобно вращающихся глаз; три носа, подергивающихся  и принюхивающихся в их направлении; три мокрых пасти с серебристыми нитями слюны, свисающих с  желтоватых клыков.       Пес стоял неподвижно, уставившись на них всеми шестью глазами, и Гарри знал, что они до сих  пор живы только потому, что он удивлен их внезапным появлением, но ступор явно рассеивался и  громовое рычание было недвусмысленным.       Гарри схватился за дверную ручку -- между Филчем и смертью он выбирает Филча.       Они выпали спиной в коридор -- Гарри захлопнул дверь, и они побежали, почти полетели обратно.  Филч, видимо, ушел искать их где-то еще, потому что они не встретились с ним, но они и не смотрели  -- все, чего им хотелось, это оказаться как можно дальше от монстра. Не останавливаясь, они  добежали до портрета толстой дамы на седьмом этаже.        -- Где вы шляетесь? -- спросила она, разглядывая их расхристанные халаты и красные потные  лица.        -- Неважно. Поросячий пятачок, поросячий пятачок, -- выдохнул Гарри, и портрет откачнулся. Они  ввалились в гостиную и рухнули, дрожа, в кресла.        Прошло время, прежде чем кто-то из них смог заговорить. Невилль вообще выглядел так, будто не  заговорит уже никогда.        -- Интересно, о чем они думали, запирая такое чудовище в школе? -- сказал наконец Рон. -- Если  какая-то собака и нуждается в прогулке, то именно эта.       Дыхание вернулось к Гермионе вместе с дурным настроением.       -- Кто-нибудь из вас пользуется глазами, или нет? -- рявкнула она. -- Вы что, не видели, на чем оно  стоит?       -- На полу? -- предположил Гарри. -- Я как-то не смотрел ей на лапы, был занят головами.       -- Нет, не на полу. Оно стояло на люке. Очевидно, оно что-то охраняет.        Она встала, злобно глядя на них.       -- Полагаю, вы очень довольны собой. Мы могли все погибнуть, хуже -- нас могли исключить.  Теперь, если вы не возражаете, я пойду спать.       Рон проводил ее взглядом, открыв рот.       -- Нет, мы не возражаем, -- сказал он. -- Можно подумать, мы ее силком за собой тащили, правда?  ",4120,2682,,
potter.pdf,ru,31,"      На Кингс Кросс прибыли в пол-одиннадцатого. Дядя Вернон швырнул сундук Гарри на тележку и  откатил на станцию. Гарри подумал было, что это неожиданно мило со стороны дяди Вернона, но тот  внезапно остановился, повернувшись к платформам с мерзкой ухмылкой на лице.       -- Ну вот, парень, ты приехал. Платформа девять -- платформа десять. Твоя должна быть где-то  посредине, но, похоже, ее еще не построили, а?        Он был, к сожалению, прав. Большая девятка висела над одной платформой, большая десятка  над другой, а между ними -- между ними не было ничего.       ""Счастливого учебного года "", -- произнес дядя Вернон с еще более гадкой улыбкой. Не сказав  больше ни слова, он удалился. Обернувшись, Гарри увидел, как Дарсли отъезжают на своей машине.  Все трое смеялись. У Гарри пересохло во рту. Что теперь делать? Из-за Гедвиги он начал привлекать  к себе люпытствующие взгляды. Надо было срочно кого-нибудь спросить.       Он остановил проходившего мимо станционного служащего, но не рискнул упомянуть платформу  девять и три четверти. Смотритель никогда не слышал о Хогвартсе, и вышел из себя, когда Гарри не  смог сообщить, в какой части страны это находится. Как будто Гарри нарочно прикидывался идиотом.  Начиная отчаиваться, Гарри спросил про поезд, отходящий в одиннадцать часов, но смотритель  ответил, что такого тоже нет. В конце концов смотритель удалился, бормоча про всяких, из-за которых  только время теряешь.       Теперь Гарри изо всех сил старался не паниковать. Судя по тому, что показывали  большие часы над расписанием, у него оставалось десять минут, чтобы сесть на поезд, а он не  представлял, как это сделать. Он торчал посреди станции с неподъемным сундуком, карманами,  полными волшебных денег и здоровенной совой.       Должно быть, Хагрид не упомянул некое действие, вроде постукивания по третьему слева кирпичу,  когда проходишь в Диагональный проулок. Может, достать волшебную палочку и постучать ею по  билетному компостеру между платформами девять и десять...         В этот момент позади него прошла группа людей, и донесся обрывок разговора:       -- Магглов, конечно, битком набито...       Гарри круто развернулся. Говорила пухленькая женщина, обращаясь к четырем огненно-рыжим  мальчикам. Каждый из них толкал перед собою такой же, как у Гарри, сундук, а главное --  у них была  сова.       С колотящимся сердцем Гарри двинул свою тележку следом. Они остановились, и он тоже,  достаточно близко, чтобы слышать разговор.        -- Ну, какая платформа? -- спросила мальчиков мама.       -- Девять и три четверти, -- встряла державшаяся за ее руку маленькая девочка, тоже ярко-рыжая. - - Мама, можно я тоже...       -- Ты еще мала, Джинни, помолчи пока немножко. Так, Перси, ты первый...       Мальчик, который выглядел старше других, двинулся в сторону девятой и десятой платформ.  Гарри смотрел, стараясь не мигать, чтобы ничего не пропустить -- но как только мальчик достиг  барьера между двумя платформами, его заслонила большая толпа туристов, и к моменту, когда из  виду убрался последний рюкзак, мальчик исчез.       -- Фред, ты следующий, -- сказала женщина.        -- Я не Фред, я Джордж -- сказал мальчик. -- И ты, женщина, называешь себя нашей матерью?  Неужели ты не видишь, что я Джордж?       -- Извини, Джордж, дорогой.       -- Шучу, я Фред, -- сказал мальчик и был таков. Близнец крикнул ему вслед, чтобы тот  поторапливался, и он, очевидно, так и сделал, потому что секундой позже тоже исчез -- но как?       Теперь уже третий мальчик бодро направлялся к барьеру -- был еще здесь -- и вот, внезапно, его  уже не стало.       Другого выхода не оставалось.       -- Извините, -- обратился Гарри к пухленькой женщине.       -- Здравствуй, дорогой, -- сказала она. -- Впервые в Хогвартс? Рон тоже новенький.       Она указала на последнего и младшего из своих сыновей. Он был высокий, худой и подвижный,  весь в веснушках, большерукий и большеногий, и с длинным носом.       -- Да, -- сказал Гарри. -- Дело в том, что... Я не знаю, как мне...       -- Попасть на платформу? -- спросила она ласково, и Гарри кивнул.       -- Не волнуйся, -- сказала она, -- Нужно всего лишь идти прямо на барьер между платформами  девять и десять. Очень важно не останавливаться и не бояться врезаться.  Если побаиваешься, то  лучше разбегись. Давай, иди сейчас, перед Роном.       -- Э-э, -- О""кей, -- сказал Гарри.       Он взялся за тележку и взглянул на барьер. Тот выглядел очень твердым.  ",4438,2779,,
potter.pdf,ru,94,"Двигались только глаза, смотревшие на них в ужасе.       -- Что ты с ним сделала? -- прошептал Гарри.       -- Это Полное Оцепенение, -- несчастным голосом сказала Гермиона. -- Невилль, миленький, мне  так жаль...        Нам пришлось, Невилль, некогда объяснять, -- сказал Гарри       -- Ты все поймешь позже, Невилль, -- сказал Рон. Они перешагнули через него и натянули Плащ- Невидимку.       Но Невилль, брошенный на полу в неподвижности, явно не был хорошей приметой . В таком  взвинченном состоянии тень любой статуи казалась Филчем, каждый отдаленный вздох ветра --  Пивсом, несущимся из темноты.        У подножия первой лестницы они заметили миссис Норрис, расхаживавшую по площадке.       -- Ой, давай пнем ее, хоть разок, -- прошептал Рон на ухо Гарри, но Гарри покачал головой. Они  осторожно прокрались мимо нее, но Миссис Норрис только поглядела в их сторону своими глазами- лампами, и ничего не сделала.        Вплоть до лестницы на третий этаж они больше никого не встретили. Тут они увидели Пивса,  который посреди лестницы высвобождал ковер, чтобы кто-нибудь зацепился и грохнулся.        -- Кто это тута? -- спросил он внезапно, как только они приблизились, прищурив свои злобные  черные глазки. -- Знаю, ты тут, хоть не вижу тебя. Ты дух, или призрак, или мелкий проказник?       Он взлетел в воздух и парил, напряженно приглядываясь.       -- Надо звать Филча, ох надо, кто-то шатается тут невидимкой...       Гарри внезапно осенило:       -- Пивс, -- проговорил он хриплым шепотом. -- У Кровавого Барона есть свои резоны быть  невидимым.       Пивс чуть не свалился от ужаса, он спохватился только в футе от ступенек, где и завис.       -- Прошу прощения, Ваша Кровавость, Господин Барон, сэр, -- масляно сказал он. -- Ошибочка,  вышла ошибочка -- не увидал Вас -- да я и не мог, Вы ведь невидимы, -- простите старому Пивсику его  шуточки, сэр.       -- У меня здесь дело, Пивс, -- проскрипел Гарри. -- Держись отсюда подальше этой ночью.        -- Слушаюсь, сэр, я слушаюсь, -- сказал Пивс, снова взлетая в воздух. -- Надеюсь, ваше дело  удастся, я вас не побеспокою.       И он усвистал.       -- Блестяще, Гарри! -- прошептал Рон.        Пару секунд спустя они стояли перед дверью в коридор третьего этажа -- и она уже была  приоткрыта.        -- Ну вот, -- тихо сказал Гарри. -- Снэйп уже миновал Пушка.       Вид открытой двери заставил их осознать, с чем они столкнулись. Гарри повернулся под плащом к  друзьям.       -- Если хотите вернуться, я вас осуждать не буду, -- сказал он. -- Возьмите Плащ, он мне не  понадобится.       -- Не будь дураком, -- сказал Рон.       -- Мы идем, -- сказала Гермиона.       Гарри толкнул дверь.       Дверь заскрипела, и они услышали, низкое утробное рычание. Все три носа засопели,  принюхиваясь, в их направлении, хотя видеть их пес не мог.       -- Что это там валяется? -- спросила Гермиона.       -- Похоже на арфу, -- сказал Рон. -- Наверно, Снэйп бросил.       -- Он, наверное, просыпается, как только перестаешь играть, -- сказал Гарри. -- Ну, начали...       Он поднес дудку Хагрида к губам и подул. Мелодией это назвать было трудно, но после первой же  ноты глаза собаки стали закрываться. Гарри боялся вздохнуть. Медленно-медленно рычание стихло,  лапы подогнулись и собака, в глубоком сне, опустилась на пол.        -- Играй-играй, -- предупредил Рон, пока они снимали Плащ и подбирались к люку, ощущая на себе  горячее зловонное собачье дыхание.       -- Думаю, мы сможем его открыть, -- сказал Рон, заглядывая через собаку. -- Пойдешь первой,  Гермиона?         -- Нет, не хочу!       -- Ладно. -- Рон сжал зубы и осторожно переступил через собачьи лапы. Нагнувшись, он потянул за  кольцо на крышке, оно подалось, и люк распахнулся.       -- Что там? -- нетерпеливо спросила Гермиона.       -- Ничего -- темнота -- никак не слезешь -- придется прыгать.   ",3832,2495,,
potter.pdf,ru,86,"     -- Но это работа для персонала, это не дело учащихся. Я думал, мы будем писать прописи, или  что-то в этом роде. Если мой отец узнает об этом...       -- Скажу тебе, в Хогвартсе у нас так. -- рыкнул Хагрид. -- Прописи писать! Какой в том толк? Делай  чего-то полезное, а нет -- так вылетай! Если думаешь, что твоему папаше это больше по вкусу,  можешь идти в замок и паковать барахло. Пошли!       Малфой не шелохнулся. Он яростно взирал на Хагрида, но потом опустил глаза.        -- А теперь, -- сказал Хагрид, -- слушайте внимательно, все же это опасно, что мы собираемся  делать нынче, а я не хочу, чтоб вы рисковали. Идите на минутку за мной.          Он подвел их к самому краю леса. Подняв лампу повыше, он нагнулся, отыскивая тропу, которая  исчезала за густыми черными деревьями. Легкий ветерок шевелил волосы.       -- Смотрите сюда, -- говорил Хагрид. -- Видите эту светящую шткуку на земле? Это кровь  единорога. Тут единорог, которого кто-то сильно ранил. Второй за неделю. Я уж нашел одного  прошлую среду. Мы должны постараться отыскать бедняжку. Может, удастся ему помочь.       -- А что, если то, что ранило единорога, найдет нас раньше? -- спросил Малфой, не сумев скрыть  дрожь в голосе.       -- Ничто, живущее в Лесу, не навредит тебе, если ты со мной или с Клыком, -- ответил Хагрид. -- И  держитесь тропы. Счас мы разделимся на две группы и пойдем по следу в обе стороны. Тут повсюду  кровь, он, должно быть, с прошлой ночи мечется повсюду, бедолага.       -- Я хочу Клыка, -- быстро сказал Малфой, поглядев на длинные зубы волкодава.       -- Ладно, но имей в виду, он трус, -- сказал Хагрид. -- Так что я, Гарри и Гермиона пойдем в одну  сторону, а Драко, Невилль и Клык -- в другую. Если кто отыщет единорога, пошлет зеленые искры,  так? Достньте палочки и потренируйтесь -- вот так -- а если с кем чего случится, пошлите красные, мы  придем и найдем вас, ну, будьте осторожны -- пошли.       Лес был темен и тих. Узкая тропинка раздваивалась, Гарри, Гермиона и Хагрид направились по  левой части, а Малфой, Невилль и Клык -- по правой.        Они шли молча, внимательно глядя под ноги. Тут и там лунные лучи, пробиваясь сквозь ветви  деревьев, освещали пятна серебряной крови на опавших листьях.        Гарри заметил, что Хагрид очень обеспокоен.        -- Может, это оборотень убивает единорогов? -- спросил Гарри.       -- Ему быстроты не хватило б, -- ответил Хагрид. -- Не так-то просто изловить единорога, это  могущественное волшебное существо. Я никогда раньше не видел, чтоб им вредили.       Они прошли мимо толстого пня, обросшего мхом. Гарри услышал журчание воды; где-то  поблизости был ручей. Здесь тропа изгибалась, и тут тоже все было в крови единорога.        -- Ты в порядке, Гермиона? -- прошептал Хагрид -- Не волнуйтесь, он не мог уйти далеко, если так  сильно ранен, мы сможем... -- СТАНЬТЕ ЗА ДЕРЕВО!       Хагрид сгреб Гарри и Гермиону и сдвинул их с тропы за большой дуб. Он выхватил из колчана  стрелу, вложил ее в арбалет, поднял его и приготовился к атаке. Все прислушивались. Что-то  скользило по листьям рядом: казалось, будто по земле волокут плащ. Хагрид прищурился,  вглядываясь в темноту, но звук через несколько секунд удалился.       -- Так я и знал, -- пробормотал Хагрид. -- Есть тут что-то, чего быть не должно.       -- Оборотень? -- предположил Гарри.       -- Ни оборотень, ни единорог, -- мрачно сказал Хагрид. -- Ладно, пошли, но давай осторожно.       Они шли теперь медленнее, прислушиваясь к малейшему звуку. Вдруг что-то определенно  шевельнулось за просветом между деревьями.        -- Кто там? -- крикнул Хагрид. -- Покажись -- я вооружен!       И на полянку вышел -- но был то человек или конь? До пояса это был человек, с рыжими волосами  и бородой, но ниже было лоснящееся, каштановое лошадиное туловище с длинным рыжим хвостом. У  Гарри и Гермионы упала челюсть.       -- А, это ты, Ронан, -- с облегчением выдохнул Хагрид. -- Как дела?       Он подошел и поздоровался с кентавром за руку.        -- Доброго тебе вечера, Хагрид, -- произнес кентавр. У него был глубокий, скорбный голос. -- Ты  хотел застрелить меня?       -- Лишняя осторожность тут не помешает, Ронан, -- сказал Хагрид, опуская арбалет. -- Что-то  дурное творится в Лесу. Это Гарри Поттер и Гермиона Грейнджер. Ученики в школе.  Эй вы, двое, а это Ронан. Он кентавр.       -- Мы заметили, -- слабым голосом ответила Гермиона.       -- Добрый вечер, -- сказал Ронан. -- Ученики, да? И много вы выучили в этой школе?       -- Э-э...       -- Кое-что, -- кротко сказала Гермиона.  ",4530,2887,,
potter.pdf,ru,95,"     Гарри, не прерывая игру, помахал Рону, чтобы привлечь его внимание и указал на себя.       -- Хочешь быть первым? Ты уверен? -- спросил Рон. -- Не знаю, насколько там глубоко. Отдай  дудку Гермионе, она будет усыплять собаку.       Гарри передал дудку. За несколько секунд тишины пес успел дернуться и зарычать, но Гермиона  начала играть, и он снова погрузился в сон.       Гарри перелез через пса и заглянул в люк. Дна видно не было.        Он опустился в дыру и повис на кончиках пальцев. Подняв глаза на Рона, он сказал:       -- Если со мной что-нибудь случится, не прыгайте. Бегите в совятник и шлите Гедвигу прямо к  Дамбльдору, ясно?       --Ясно, -- ответил Рон.       -- Надеюсь, увидимся через минуту.        И он разжал руки. В ушах засвистел холодный влажный воздух, он падал вниз -- вниз -- вниз...       ХЛОП. С забавным глухим звуком он приземлился на что-то мягкое. Похоже, он сидел на каком-то  растении.        -- Все в порядке! -- закричал он в сторону квадратика света, величиной с почтовую марку, который  был открытым люком. -- Тут мягко, можно прыгать.        Сверху сиганул Рон. Он приземлился рядом с Гарри.        -- Что это такое? -- были его первые слова.        -- Не знаю, растение какое-то. Думаю, чтоб падать было мягче. Давай, Гермиона!       Отдаленная музыка прекратилась. Раздался громкий лай собаки, но Гермиона уже прыгнула. Она  приземлилась по другую сторону от Гарри.       -- Мы, должно быть, находимся в милях под школой, -- сказала она.       -- Повезло, что тут это растение, правда? -- заметил Рон.        -- Повезло? -- взвизгнула Гермиона. -- Посмотрите на себя!       Она вскочила и прорвалась к стене. Прорываться пришлось потому, что как только она  приземлилась, растение начало опутывать ее щиколотки змеевидными побегами. А у Гарри и Рона  ноги уже были накрепко спутаны длинными плетями, хотя они этого не замечали.       Гермиона успела освободиться, прежде чем растение туго ее опутало. Теперь она в ужасе  смотрела на мальчишек, которые сражались с растением, пытаясь скинуть его с себя, но чем больше  они боролись, тем быстрее и гуще растение оплетало их.       -- Не шевелитесь! -- велела им Гермиона. -- Я знаю, что это такое -- это Силки Дьявола.       -- Как я рад, что мы знаем его название, от этого гораздо легче, -- огрызнулся Рон, отклоняясь,  чтобы не дать растению обвиться вокруг шеи.       -- Заткнись, я пытаюсь вспомнить, как его уничтожить, -- сказала Гермиона.       -- Так поспеши, я уже дышать не могу, -- задыхался Гарри, отталкивая побег, сжимающий его грудь.       -- Силки Дьявола, Силки Дьявола... Что говорила профессор Спраут? Они любят темноту и  сырость...       -- Так разожги огонь! -- выдавил Гарри.       -- Да -- конечно же -- но тут нет ничего для растопки... -- вскричала Гермиона, заламывая руки.       -- ТЫ СПЯТИЛА, ЧТО ЛИ? -- обрушился на нее Рон. -- ВЕДЬМА ТЫ ИЛИ НЕТ?       -- Ах да, -- спохватилась Гермиона, выхватила палочку, взмахнула ею, что-то пробормотала и  направила на растение клуб того же голубого пламени, что когда-то так удачно применила к Снэйпу.  Не прошло нескольких секунд, как мальчики почувствовали, что тиски ослабевают, по мере того, как  побеги уползают от света и огня. Извиваясь и корчась, они сползли с их тел, и мальчики смогли  освободиться.        -- Хорошо, что ты учила Гербологию, Гермиона, -- сказал Гарри, присоединяясь к ней у стены и  утирая пот с лица.       -- Да-а, -- добавил Рон. -- Хорошо еще, что Гарри не потерял голову в переделке. ""Нет ничего для  растопки!"", тоже мне.       -- Сюда, -- указал Гарри на единственный здесь каменный проход.       Кроме собственных шагов они слышали только тихое журчанье воды по стенам. Проход сужался, и  это напомнило Гарри Гринготт. Его сердце неприятно екнуло, когда он вспомнил про драконов,  охраняющих особенно секретные сейфы в волшебном банке. Что, если они встретят дракона,  взрослого дракона -- им и Норберта -то вполне хватало.       -- Слышите? -- прошептал Рон.        Гарри прислушался. Сверху и спереди доносились тихий шелест и позвякивание.       -- Думаешь, там привидение?       -- Не знаю... Звучит, как хлопанье крыльев.       -- Впереди свет -- я вижу, как что-то движется.  ",4186,2664,,
potter.pdf,ru,67,"     -- Его спровоцировали, профессор, -- вступился Хагрид, высовывая из-за елки огромное волосатое  лицо. -- Малфой нападал на его семью.       -- Даже если так, драка есть нарушение школьных правил, Хагрид, -- любезно пояснил Снэйп. --  Пять баллов с Гриффиндора, Уизли, и благодари, что не больше. Ступайте.       Малфой, Крабб и Гойл продрались мимо дерева, рассыпая во все стороны иглы и ухмыляясь.       -- Я его достану, -- проговорил Рон, скрежеща зубами вслед Малфою. -- Однажды я его достану.       -- Ненавижу обоих, -- сказал Гарри. -- И Малфоя, и Снэйпа.       -- Да ладно, плюньте, скоро Рождество, -- утешал их Хагрид. -- Знашь что, пошли со мной, покажу  Большой Зал, это что-то.       Гарри, Рон и Гермиона пошли за Хагридом и его елкой в Большой Зал, где профессор МакГонагалл  и профессор Флитвик занимались рождественскими украшениями.       -- Ага, Хагрид, последнее дерево -- поставь, пожалуйста, в дальний угол.       Зал выглядел впечатляюще. Гирлянды из остролиста и канители висели по стенам, и не менее  дюжины рождественских елок украшало зал. Некоторые поблескивали крошечными сосульками,  некоторые светились от сотен свечей.        -- Сколько дней вам осталось до каникул? -- спросил Хагрид       -- Всего один, -- сказала Гермиона, -- и это, кстати, напомнило мне, -- Гарри, Рон, у нас есть  полчаса до ланча, нам надо в библиотеку.       -- Ой да, точно, -- подтвердил Рон, отворачиваясь от профессора Флитвика, который выдувал из  своей палочки золотые шары на ветки только что принесенного дерева.        -- Библиотека? -- изумился Хагрид, выходя из Зала вслед за ними. -- Прям перед каникулами?  Шутите, да?       -- Мы не работать, -- лучезарно пояснил ему Гарри. -- С тех пор, как ты упомянул Николаса  Фламеля, мы пытаемся отыскать, кто это.       -- Вы -- чего? -- Хагрид выглядел потрясенным. -- Слушай сюда -- говорил я вам -- бросьте это. Вас  не касает, что сторожит собачка.       -- Мы просто хотим знать, кто такой Николас Фламель, вот и все, -- сказала Гермиона.       -- Может, ты нам скажешь и избавишь нас от возни? -- добавил Гарри. -- Мы перерыли, должно  быть, сотни книг, и нигде его не нашли -- ты хоть намекни -- я точно знаю, что где-то о нем читал.       -- Ничо не скажу, -- решительно заявил Хагрид.       -- Придется тогда самим найти, -- сказал Рон, и они поспешили в библиотеку, оставив Хагрида  довольно обескураженным.       Они действительно искали имя Фламеля в книгах с тех самых пор, как оно сорвалось у Хагрида с  языка, потому что как еще могли они узнать, что же такое пытается украсть Снэйп? Проблема была в  том, что трудно было понять, откуда начинать поиски, не зная, что ж такого сделал Фламель, чтобы  попать в книги.  Его не было ни в Великих Волшебниках Двадцатого Столетия, ни в Именах  Выдающихся Магов Нашего Времени; он был также пропущен в Важнейших Магических Открытиях  Современности и в Исследованиях Современного Развития Магии. К тому же удручали размеры  библиотеки: десятки тысяч книг; тысячи полок; сотни длинных рядов.       Гермиона составила список предметов и наименований, которые считала нужным просмотреть,  Рон же просто слонялся вдоль книжных рядов, иногда вытаскивая с полок произвольную книгу. Гарри  крутился возле Закрытой Секции. Он сильно подозревал, что Фламель должен быть где-нибудь там. К  несчастью, чтобы заглянуть в книги Закрытой Секции, нужно было иметь записку, подписанную кем-то  из учителей, и Гарри знал, что ему такую не получить. Там хранились книги, содержащие могучую  Темную Магию, которую никогда не преподавали в Хогвартсе, и только старшеклассники,  специализирующиеся в Защите от Темных Сил, иногда читали их.       -- Что ты ищешь, мальчик?       -- Ничего, -- ответил Гарри.       Библиотекарша мадам Пинс замахала на него перьевой метелкой для пыли.       -- Тогда тебе лучше уйти. Уходи!       Сожалея, что не успел придумать какого-нибудь вразумительного предлога, Гарри вышел из  библиотеки. Они с Роном и Гермионой еще раньше решили не спрашивать у мадам Пинс, где можно  найти Фламеля. Они были уверены, что она знает, но тут был риск, что Снэйп узнает, что они ищут.       Гарри ждал снаружи, найдут ли что-нибудь остальные двое, но не очень-то на это рассчитывал. Тут  можно было искать две недели, а у них были только редкие промежутки между уроками, так что  неудивительно, что ничего не находилось. Что им действительно было нужно -- долгий обстоятельный  поиск без мадам Пинс, стоящей над душой.        Через пять минут Рон и Гермиона, отрицательно тряся головами, присоединились к нему. Они  пошли есть.   ",4553,2822,,
potter.pdf,ru,54,"     -- И тебе хватает наглости...-- громко сказал Рон.       -- Заткнитесь оба, -- прикрикнул Гарри. -- Я что-то слышу.       Это было какое-то сопение.       -- Миссис Норрис? -- выдохнул Рон, вглядываясь в темноту.       Это была не Миссис Норрис. Это был Невилль. Он спал, свернувшись калачиком на полу, но  подскочил, проснувшись, стоило им подкрасться ближе.       -- Слава Богу, что вы нашли меня! Я провел тут целую вечность. Я забыл новый пароль и не мог  пройти в спальню.       -- Тише, Невилль. Пароль: ""Поросячий пятачок"", но тебе это не поможет, потому что толстая дама  куда-то смылась.        -- Как твоя рука? -- спросил Гарри.       -- Отлично, -- сказал Невилль, показывая руку. -- Мадам Помфри починила ее за минуту.       -- Хорошо. Смотри, Невилль, нам надо тут попасть кое-куда, увидимся позже...       -- Не оставляйте меня, -- взмолился Невилль, вскакивая на ноги. -- Я не хочу оставаться тут один,  Кровавый Барон проходил мимо уже два раза.        Рон взглянул на часы и злобно уставился на Невилля с Гермионой.       -- Если кого-нибудь из нас поймают, я не успокоюсь, пока не выучу Сопливый Наговор, о котором  говорил Квиррелл, и не применю его к вам.       Гермиона открыла рот, видимо, чтобы рассказать Рону, как именно употребляется Сопливый  Наговор, но Гарри шикнул на нее и потащил всех вперед.       Они скользили вдоль коридоров, полосатых от лунного света, падающего из высоких окон. За  каждым поворотом Гарри ожидал наткнуться на Филча или Миссис Норрис, но им везло. Они  взбежали по лестнице на третий этаж и прошли на цыпочках к комнате для наград.        Малфоя и Крабба еще не было. Хрустальные витрины с кубками поблескивали в лунном свете.  Кубки, щиты, таблички и статуэтки отсвечивали серебром и золотом в темноте. Они крались вдоль  стены, поглядывая на обе двери, ведущие из комнаты. Гарри вытащил палочку, на случай, если  внезапно выскочит Малфой. Минуты текли.       -- Опаздывает, может, сдрейфил, -- прошептал Рон.       Шум, раздавшийся в соседней комнате, заставил их подскочить. Только Гарри поднял палочку, как  они услышали голос, и это был не Малфой.       -- Понюхай, понюхай, моя радость, они могут скрываться за углом.       Это Филч разговаривал с Миссис Норрис. В ужасе Гарри дико замахал остальным идти за ним как  можно быстрее; они молча побежали к дальнему от Филча выходу. Мантия Невилля скользнула за  угол как раз когда Филч вошел в комнату для наград.       -- Они где-то здесь, -- бормотал он. -- Наверное, прячутся.       -- Сюда, -- безмолвно прокричал Гарри, и, напуганные до смерти, они прокрались по длинной  галерее, заставленной доспехами. Было слышно, как Филч приближался. Внезапно Невилль  испуганно пискнул и кинулся бежать, споткнулся, схватил Рона за пояс и они оба свалились прямо на  доспехи.       Звоном и грохотом можно было разбудить весь замок.       -- БЕЖИМ! -- заорал Гарри, и вся четверка рванула по галерее, не оглядываясь, есть ли сзади  Филч. Они крутанулись вокруг колонны и помчались, минуя один коридор за другим. Гарри бежал  впереди, абсолютно не представляя, где они, и куда направляются. Они прорвались сквозь гобелен и  оказались в скрытом проходе, пробежав по которому, вышли около кабинета Чар, который находился  очень далеко от комнаты наград.        -- Похоже, оторвались, -- выдохнул Гарри, прислонясь к холодной стене и вытирая пот со лба.  Невилль согнулся вдвое, дыша со свистом и давясь.       -- Я... вам... говорила...-- задыхалась Гермиона, вцепившись в вышивку на груди. -- Я... вам...  говорила...       -- Нам надо вернуться в башню Гриффиндора, -- проговорил Рон. -- Как можно быстрее.       -- Малфой надул тебя, -- сказала Гарри Гермиона, -- Теперь-то ты это понял? Он и не собирался с  тобой встречаться. Филч наверняка знал, что кто-то будет в комнате наград, Малфой его и навел.        Гарри подумал, что она, скорее всего, права, но признать это было выше его сил.        -- Пошли.       Но это было не так-то просто. Они не сделали и дюжины шагов, как задребезжала дверная ручка, и  что-то пробкой вылетело из ближайшего класса.       Это был Пивс. Он увидел их и взвизгнул от удовольствия.        -- Заткнись, Пивс, пожалуйста -- нас же исключат.       Пивс захихикал.  ",4207,2696,,
potter.pdf,ru,17,"     Хагрид выглядел, как будто сейчас взорвется.       -- ДАРСЛИ! -- гаркнул он.       Дядюшка Вернон, который стал очень бледным, прошептал что-то вроде: ""Мня... Мне..."" Хагрид  яростно уставился на Гарри.       -- Но ты просто обязан знать про своих маму с папой, -- сказал он. -- Они знамениты. Ты знаменит.       -- Что? Моя -- мои мама с папой были знамениты, да?       -- Так ты не знаешь... Не знаешь... -- бормотал Хагрид, запустив пальцы в волосы и глядя на Гарри  в замешательстве.        -- Так ты не знаешь, кто ты? -- наконец произнес он.       Дядюшка Вернон внезапно обрел дар речи.        -- Стоп! -- скомандовал он. -- Остановитесь, сэр! Я запрещаю вам говорить мальчику что-либо!       И более храбрый человек, чем дядя Вернон, спасовал бы перед тем неистовым взглядом, которым  наградил его Хагрид; когда Хагрид заговорил, каждый слог вибрировал от ярости.       -- Вы никогда не говорили ему? Не говорили, что было в письме, которое оставил Дамбльдор? Я  был там! Я видел, Дарсли, как Дамбльдор клал его! И вы скрывали от него все эти годы!       -- Что от меня скрывали? -- нетерпеливо спросил Гарри.       -- СТОЙТЕ! Я ЗАПРЕЩАЮ! -- панически завизжал дядя Вернон.       Тетя Петуния в ужасе ахнула.        -- Да провалитесь, вы оба, -- сказал Хагрид. -- Гарри, ты -- волшебник.       В хижине воцарилась тишина. Были слышны только шум моря и свист ветра.       -- Я -- кто? -- выдохнул Гарри.       -- Волшебник, само собой, --сказал Хагрид, снова садясь на диван, который заскрипел и прогнулся  еще сильнее. -- И чертовски хороший, я бы сказал, тебе только надо немного подучиться. А кем бы  тебе еще быть, с такими-то родителями? Я думаю, тебе пора прочесть письмо.       Гарри протянул руку и наконец получил желтоватый конверт, надписанный изумрудно-зелеными  чернилами: Мистер Г. Поттер, На полу, Хижина-на-Скале, Море. Он вытащил письмо и прочел:                                 ХОГВАРТС -- ШКОЛА МАГИИ И КОЛДОВСТВА                                   Директор: Альбус Дамбльдор              (Ордена Мерлина, Первая степень, Высший уровень, Ведущий Колдун,              Верховный Магистр, Международная Конфедерация Волшебников)    Дорогой Мистер Поттер,       Мы рады вам сообщить, что вы приняты в Хогвартскую Школу Магии и Колдовства. Посылаем  вам перечень необходимых книг и принадлежностей.        Семестр начинается 1 сентября. Сову с подтверждением высылать не позднее 31 июля.                                                                                                                Искренне ваша,                                                                                     Минерва МакГонагалл,                                                                                      Заместитель директора.         Вопросы в голове Гарри вспыхивали, как огни фейерверка, и он не мог решить, какой задать  первым. Через несколько минут он, заикаясь, спросил:       -- Что это значит: сова с подтверждением?       -- Тысяча горгон, ты напомнил мне, -- спохватился Хагрид, хлопая себя по лбу с силой,  достаточной, чтобы свалить вьючную лошадь. Из очередного кармана своего пальто он вытащил сову  -- настоящую, живую, довольно взъерошенную сову, гусиное перо и свиток пергамента. Прикусив  зубами кончик языка, он нацарапал записку, которую Гарри прочел кверх ногами:                           Дорогой мистер Дамбльдор,       Отдал Гарри его письмо. Завтра поедем покупать вещи. Погода жуткая. Надеюсь, вы в порядке.                                                                                              Хагрид         Хагрид скрутил записку, дал сове, которая зажала ее в клюве, подошел к двери и выбросил сову  прямо в бурю. Затем он вернулся и сел как ни в чем не бывало, словно по телефону поговорил.       Гарри вдруг понял, что сидит, открыв рот, и быстро закрыл его.       -- На чем я остановился? -- спросил Хагрид, но в этот момент дядя Вернон, все еще пепельного  цвета, но очень сердитый, снова вышел на свет.

potter.pdf,ru,52,"     -- Пивс, вон! -- рявкнула она. Пивс с громким стуком выронил мелок и испарился. Профессор  Макгонагалл затворила за ним дверь и повернулась к мальчикам.       -- Поттер, это Оливер Вуд. Вуд -- я нашла тебе Ловца.       Выражение лица Вуда сменилось с озадаченного на счастливое.       -- Вы серьезно, Профессор?       -- Абсолютно. -- Твердо ответила профессор МакГонагалл. -- Этот мальчик -- самородок. В жизни  ничего подобного не видела. Это ты впервые сел на метлу, Поттер?       Гарри молча кивнул. Он не понимал, что происходит, но было непохоже, что его исключают, и у  него появилось странная дрожь в коленках.       -- Он поймал эту штуку рукой после пятидесятифутового пике, -- рассказывала Вуду профессор  МакГонагалл. -- И ни царапины. Чарли Уизли так бы не сумел.       Вуд выглядел так, будто бы все его мечты исполнились в одночасье.       -- Ты хоть видел игру в Квиддич, Поттер? -- спросил он с восторгом.       -- Вуд -- капитан команды Гриффиндора, -- пояснила профессор МакГонагалл.       -- Он прямо создан, чтоб быть Ловцом, -- приговаривал тем временем Вуд, обходя Гарри кругом и  разглядывая со всех сторон. -- Легкий... Быстрый... Надо выделить ему достойную метлу, Профессор - - Нимбус две тысячи или Клинсвип семь, я считаю.       -- Я поговорю с Профессором Дамбльдором, сможем ли мы нарушить правило насчет первого года.  Видит Бог, нам нужна команда лучше, чем в прошлом году. Я несколько недель не могла взглянуть  Северусу Снэйпу в глаза, после того, как мы продули Слиферину последний матч.       Профессор МакГонагалл строго глянула на Гарри поверх очков.        -- Я хочу услышать, Поттер, что ты упорно тренируешься, а то я передумаю насчет твоего  наказания.       Затем она вдруг улыбнулась.       -- Твой отец мог бы гордиться, -- сказала она. -- Он и сам был великолепным игроком в Квиддич.                  -- Ты шутишь.       Это было во время обеда. Гарри только что закончил рассказывать Рону, что с ним случилось  после того, как профессор МакГонагалл увела его с площадки. Рон ел мясной пудинг, да так и застыл  с куском, не донесенным до рта.        -- Ловцом? -- переспросил он. -- Но первокурсники никогда... Ты будешь самым младшим игроком  за...       -- столетие, -- подхватил Гарри, запихивая в рот пудинг. Он определенно проголодался после  дневных переживаний. -- Мне Вуд говорил.       Рон был так восхищен и потрясен, что просто сидел и любовался Гарри.       -- Я начинаю тренироваться со следующей недели, -- сказал Гарри. -- Только не говори никому. Вуд  хочет, чтоб это было в секрете.       В зал вошли Фред и Джордж Уизли. Они заметили Гарри и поспешили к нему.        -- Здорово! -- Джордж понизил голос. -- Вуд рассказал нам. Мы тоже в команде -- Защитники.       -- Говорю вам, мы точно выиграем Кубок Квиддича в этом году. -- добавил Фред. -- Мы не  выигрывали с тех пор, как Чарли выбыл, но в этом году, похоже, у нас будет потрясная команда. Ты,  должно быть, хорош, Гарри. Вуд прямо подпрыгивал, когда рассказывал нам.       -- Ладно, мы пошли, Ли Джордан нашел новый секретный ход из школы.       -- Готов поклясться, что это тот самый, за статуей Грегори Льстивого, который мы обнаружили в  первую же неделю в школе.       Фред и Джордж едва успели исчезнуть, как подошла гораздо менее симпатичная компания --  Малфой в сопровождении Крабба и Гойла.       -- Последний ужин, Поттер? Когда собираешься на поезд, к магглам?       -- Ты как-то храбрее здесь, на земле, среди своих маленьких друзей, -- едко заметил Гарри.  Конечно, ни в Краббе, ни в Гойле не было ничего маленького, но так как за Высшим столом было  полно учителей, им оставалось только хмуриться и сжимать кулаки.        -- Я справлюсь с тобой в одиночку в любое время, -- сказал Малфой. -- Сегодня же ночью, если  хочешь. Волшебная дуэль. Только палочки -- без контакта. В чем дело?   Никогда не слыхал о волшебных дуэлях?        -- Конечно, слышал, -- Рон вылез вперед. -- Я его секундант, а кто твой?       Малфой осмотрел Крабба и Гойла, оценивая их.       -- Крабб. -- Сказал он. -- В полночь? Встретимся в комнате для наград, она никогда не запирается.        Когда Малфой ушел, Рон с Гарри переглянулись.   ",4156,2622,,
potter.pdf,ru,87,"     -- Кое-что. Что ж, уже что-то. -- вздохнул Ронан. Он запрокинул голову и посмотрел на небо. -- Марс  сегодня ярок.       -- Да, -- согласился Хагрид, тоже взглянув на небо. -- Слушай, я рад, что встретил тебя, Ронан,  потому что тут был ранен единорог -- ты чего-нибудь видал?       Ронан ответил не сразу. Он не мигая, глядел вверх, а потом снова вздохнул.       -- Невинных всегда приносят в жертву первыми, -- произнес он. -- Так было в веках, так оно и  поныне.       -- Да, -- сказал Хагрид. -- Но ты видел что-нибудь, Ронан? Что-нибудь необычное?       -- Марс сегодня ярок, -- повторил Ронан, тогда как Хагрид смотрел на него в нетерпении. --  Необычайно ярок.       -- Да, но я имел в виду что-то необычное поближе к дому, -- настаивал Хагрид. -- Ты не заметил  чего-нибудь странного?       И снова Ронан помедлил с ответом. Наконец он проронил: ""Лес хранит много тайн"".       Движение среди деревьев за спиной у Ронана заставило Хагрида снова поднять арбалет, но это  был другой кентавр, черноволосый, вороной и более дикий, чем Ронан.        -- Привет, Бэйн, -- поздоровался Хагрид. -- Как дела?        -- Добрый вечер, Хагрид. -- Надеюсь, у тебя все хорошо?        -- Неплохо. Послушай, я только что спрошал Ронана, ты не видал чего-нибудь странного в  последнее время? Потому что кто-то напал на единорога -- знаешь об этом что-нибудь?        Бэйн подошел и встал рядом с Ронаном. Затем поглядел на небо.       -- Марс ярок сегодня, -- просто ответил он.       -- Мы уже слыхали, -- с раздражением буркнул Хагрид. -- Ладно, если кто-то что-то заметит, дайте  мне знать, а? Нам пора.        Гарри и Гермиона ушли за ним с полянки, оглядываясь через плечо на Ронана и Бэйна, пока  деревья не скрыли тех из виду.       -- Никогда, -- ворчал Хагрид, -- не пробуй добиться от кентавра прямого ответа. Звездочеты  проклятые. Ничего их не интересует, что ближе луны.       -- И много их тут? -- поинтересовалась Гермиона.        -- Ну, несколько... Общаются в основном между собой, но иногда с ними можно перекинуться  словцом. Они мудрые, кентавры... Знают такое... Только из них не вытянешь.       -- Как ты думаешь, это кентавра мы слышали раньше? -- спросил Гарри.        -- Разве это был цокот копыт? Нет, по мне, это и было то, что убивает единорогов -- никогда не  слыхал такого.       Они шли сквозь густые темные деревья. Гарри то и дело нервно оглядывался. У него было мерзкое  чувство, что за ними наблюдают. Хорошо, что Хагрид взял арбалет. Они прошли очередной поворот  тропы, как вдруг Гермиона схватила Хагрида за руку.       -- Хагрид! Смотри! Красная вспышка, с другими беда!       -- Ждите здесь оба! -- заорал Хагрид. -- Стойте на тропе, я за вами вернусь!       Они стояли, напуганные, слушали, как он продирается через подлесок и переглядывались до тех  пор, пока шум шагов совсем не затих.        -- Они ведь целы, правда? -- прошептала Гермиона.        -- Мне наплевать на Малфоя, но если что-то случится с Невиллем... Ведь он оказался здесь из-за  нас...       Минуты еле ползли. Они напрягали слух. Гарри ловил каждое дуновение ветра, каждый  шорох  ветвей. Что произошло? Где остальные?             Наконец громкий шум возвестил возвращение Хагрида. Малфой, Невилль и Клык были с ним.  Хагрид дымился от злости. Оказалось, Малфой зашел сзади и в шутку схватил Невилля, а тот со  страху испустил вспышку.        -- Нам повезет, если мы отыщем хоть что-нибудь после всего тарарама, который вы устроили.  Теперь мы сменяем группы -- Невилль останется со мной и Гермионой, а ты, Гарри, пойдешь с  Клыком и этим идиотом. Прости, -- прошептал Хагрид Гарри, -- но ему будет трудненько напугать тебя,  а нам надо сделать дело.       И Гарри направился в чащу леса с Малфоем и Клыком. Они шли уже почти полчаса, забираясь все  глубже в Лес, пока по тропе стало невозможно идти из-за того, что деревья страшно сгустились. Гарри  показалось, что что пятна крови стали крупнее. На корнях деревьев были целые потеки крови, как  если бы несчастное созданье билось среди них в муках. Сквозь переплетение ветвей старого дуба  Гарри заметил просвет впереди.        -- Гляди, -- пробормотал он, протягивая руку, чтоб остановить Малфоя.        На земле светилось что-то ярко-белое. Они подошли ближе.  ",4219,2679,,
potter.pdf,ru,90,"  ПО ТУ СТОРОНУ ЛЮКА           Все грядущие годы Гарри так и не удастся вспомнить, как ему удавалось сдавать экзамены,  ежеминутно ожидая, что в дверь вот-вот вломится Волдеморт. Тем не менее дни сменяли один  другой, и пока не было сомнений в том, что Пушок за запертой дверью жив-здоров.        Было невыносимо душно и жарко, особенно в том зале, где они сдавали письменные экзамены. На  экзамене им выдали специальные новые перья, которые были обработаны заклинанием против  списывания.       Были и практические экзамены. Профессор Флитвик вызывал их в класс по одному и просил  заставить ананас сплясать на парте чечетку. Профессор МакГонагалл наблюдала, как они  превращают мышь в табакерку -- дополнительные баллы начислялись за красоту табакерки, но  сбавлялись, если у нее оставались усы. Снэйп нагонял на них нервную дрожь, дыша им в затылок в то  время, как они пытались вспомнить, как составляют Эликсир Забывчивости.        Гарри старался изо всех сил, пытаясь не обращать внимания на пронзительную боль во лбу,  которая не оставляла его со времени прогулки по Лесу. По мнению Невилля, у Гарри был  экзаменационный невроз, потому что Гарри не мог уснуть, но на самом деле деле его постоянно  будили старые кошмары, ставшие еще хуже от присутствия в них залитой кровью фигуры в капюшоне.       Может быть, потому, что они не видели в лесу того, что видел Гарри, или потому, что у них не было  болевшего шрама на лбу, но Рон и Гермиона не так переживали из-за Камня, как Гарри. Они,  разумеется, боялись Волдеморта, но он не являлся к ним во сне, к тому же подготовка к экзаменам  отнимала столько сил, что времени размышлять о намерениях Снэйпа или кого-то другого у них  просто не было.        Самым последним экзаменом была История Магии. Час ответов на вопросы о всяких трухлявых  древних волшебниках, изобретших самопомешивающиеся тигли, и впереди свобода, целая свободная  неделя до оглашения результатов экзаменов. Когда призрак профессора Биннса велел положить  перья и сдать пергаменты, Гарри невольно зааплодировал вместе со всеми.        -- Было гораздо легче, чем я думала, -- сказала Гермиона, когда они смешались с толпой,  рванувшейся на залитый солнцем двор. -- Могла бы не учить ни про Кодекс Поведения Оборотней от  1637 года, ни про восстание Элфрика Энергичного.       Гермиона была не против задним числом пройтись по всему материалу экзамена, но Рон заявил,  что его от этого тошнит, так что они просто прибежали к озеру и растянулись под деревом. Близнецы  Уизли и Ли Джордан дергали за щупальца огромного кальмара, выползшего погреться на мелководье.        -- Конец зубрежке, -- счастливо проговорил Рон, потягиваясь на траве. -- Ты мог бы быть веселее,  Гарри, у нас есть целая неделя до того, как мы узнаем, насколько мы глупы, так что пока можно не  беспокоиться.       Гарри потирал лоб.       -- Хотел бы я знать, что это означает, -- вырвалось у него. -- Мой шрам все болит и болит  --  раньше такое тоже бывало, но не так сильно.       -- Сходи к мадам Помфри, -- предложила Гермиона.       -- Я не болен, -- ответил Гарри. -- Я думаю, это предупреждение... Это значит, что опасность  близка...       Рону не хотелось напрягаться, слишком уж было жарко.       -- Расслабься, Гарри, Гермиона права, Камень в безопасности, пока Дамбльдор рядом. И нет  никаких свидетельств, что Снэйп узнал, как разобраться с Пушком. Ему однажды уже чуть не  оторвали ногу, он не будет торопиться со следующей попыткой. Скорей уж Невилль станет членом  сборной Англии по Квиддичу, чем Хагрид подставит Дамбльдора.        Гарри кивнул, но не мог избавиться от неопределенного чувства, будто забыл сделать что-то  важное. Когда он попытался объяснить это остальным, Гермиона сказала:       -- Это все экзамены. Я тоже проснулась прошлой ночью, и уже успела перечесть половину своих  записок по Трансфигурации, прежде чем вспомнила, что уже сдала ее.       Гарри все же был уверен, что беспокоящее его странное чувство не имеет отношения к занятиям.  Он наблюдал, как к школе летит сова с зажатым в клюве письмом. Он получал письма только от  Хагрида. Хагрид никогда не предаст Дамбльдора, Хагрид никому не скажет, как пройти мимо Пушка...  никогда... но --       Внезапно Гарри вскочил.        -- Ты куда? -- сонно спросил Рон.  ",4251,2666,,
potter.pdf,ru,72,"     -- Нет! -- зашипел Гарри. -- Я знаю, это где-то здесь.        Они разминулись с привидением высокой ведьмы, уплывшим в обратном направлении, но больше  никого не встретили. Когда Рон уже начал стонать, что его ноги замерзли до смерти, Гарри заметил  доспехи.       -- Это здесь -- вот здесь -- да!       Они толкнули дверь. Гарри скинул с плеч Плащ и кинулся к зеркалу.       Все были там. Его мама и папа просияли, увидев его.       -- Видишь? -- прошептал Гарри.       -- Ничего не вижу.       -- Смотри! Смотри на них... Их же там много...       -- Я вижу только тебя.       -- Ну посмотри внимательно, давай, встань на мое место.       Гарри отступил в сторону, но когда Рон встал на его место, он не видел больше своей семьи, он  видел только Рона в мятой пижаме.       Рон, однако, неотрывно смотрел на свое отражение.       -- Посмотри на меня! -- сказал он.       -- Ты видишь свою семью?       -- Нет, я один -- но я другой -- я старше -- и я Первый Ученик!       -- Что?       -- Да -- у меня значок, как был у Билла -- и я держу Кубок Домов, и Кубок Квиддича -- я еще и  Капитан команды!       Рон оторвал глаза от дивного зрелища и с восторгом взглянул на Гарри.       -- Как ты думаешь, зеркало показывает будущее?       -- Как это может быть? Вся моя семья мертва -- дай мне взглянуть...       -- Ты смотрел всю прошлую ночь, дай мне еще поглядеть       -- Ты всего только держишь Кубок, что в этом интересного? Я хочу увидеть моих родителей.       -- Не толкай меня...       Внезапный шум, донесшийся из коридора, положил конец этой дискуссии. Они только сейчас  поняли, как громко разговаривали.       -- Быстро!       Рон накинул им на головы плащ, и в этот момент светящиеся глаза Миссис Норрис заглянули в  дверь. Рон и Гарри стояли, не шевелясь, думая об одном -- сработает ли Плащ на кошке? Казалось,  прошла целая вечность, прежде чем она повернулась и ушла.       -- Это небезопасно -- она могла пойти за Филчем, клянусь, что она слышала нас. Пошли.       И Рон вытащил Гарри из комнаты.          На следующее утро снег еще не растаял.        -- Сыграем в шахматы, Гарри? -- предлагал Рон.       -- Нет.       -- Почему бы нам не сходить навестить Хагрида?       -- Нет... Ты сходи...       -- Я знаю, Гарри, ты думаешь об этом зеркале. Не ходи больше туда.       -- Почему?       -- Не знаю, но мне это не нравится. И в любом случае -- слишком много опасностей. Филч, Снэйп и  Миссис Норрис так и рыскают вокруг. Что, если они заметят тебя? Если они столкнутся с тобой? Если  ты что-нибудь уронишь?       -- Ты говоришь прямо как Гермиона.       -- Серьезно, Гарри, не ходи.       Но в голове у Гарри была только одна мысль, как снова вернуться к зеркалу, и Рон не мог его  остановить.           Следующей ночью он быстрее отыскал путь. Он шел так быстро, что не мог не наделать шума, но  он никого не встретил.       И там снова были его мама и папа, они улыбались ему, и один из дедушек махал ему радостно.  Гарри опустился и сел на пол перед зеркалом. Ничто не может помешать ему провести всю ночь со  своей семьей. Ничто на свете.       Кроме...  ",3080,2075,,
potter.pdf,ru,96,"     Они добрались до конца прохода, и перед ними оказалась ярко освещенная комната с высоким  выгнутым потолком. Она была полна крошечных, ярко переливающихся птичек, порхающих и  трепыхающихся повсюду. На противоположной стороне была тяжелая деревянная дверь.       -- Как ты думаешь, они нападут на нас, если мы пройдем через комнату? -- спросил Рон.       -- Возможно, -- ответил Гарри. -- Они не выглядят злобными, но если налетят все вместе... Ну,  делать нечего. Я побежал.       Он глубоко вздохнул, закрыл лицо руками и рванул через комнату. Он ожидал в любую минуту  почувствовать острые клювики и коготки, но ничего такого не случилось. Он добежал до двери в  целости и сохранности. Потянул дверь за ручку, но та была заперта.        Остальные двое присоединились к нему. Они тянули и толкали дверь, но она не шевельнулась,  даже когда Гермиона применила к ней Чары Алохоморы.       -- И что теперь? -- спросил Рон.       -- Эти птички... Они же не для украшения тут... -- протянула Гермиона.       Они наблюдали, как птички порхают над головами, поблескивая -- поблескивая?        -- Это не птички! -- внезапно воскликнул Гарри. -- это ключи! Крылатые ключи -- смотрите  внимательно! Это может значить... -- он оглядел комнату, пока остальные присматривались к стае  ключей. -- Да -- глядите! Метлы! Мы должны поймать ключ от двери!        -- Но тут их сотни!       Рон внимательно изучил замок.       -- Нам нужен большой, старомодный -- возможно, серебряный, как и ручка.       Они схватили метлы и взмыли в воздух, устремившись в центр тучи ключей. Они ловили и хватали,  однако заколдованные ключи уворачивались так быстро, что их было почти невозможно поймать.        Но Гарри не зря был самым юным Ловцом столетия. Он умел замечать то, что не удавалось  никому. После минутного кружения среди трепыхания радужных перьев он увидел большой  серебряный ключ с помятым крылом, словно его уже ловили и грубо засовывали в скважину.       -- Вон тот! -- закричал он осталным. -- Тот большой -- вон там, нет там -- с ярко-голубыми крыльями  -- у которого перья с одного боку помяты.       Рон быстро направился, куда указывал Гарри, врезался в потолок и едва не свалился с метлы.        -- Надо загнать его в угол! -- командовал Гарри, не отрывая глаз от ключа с поврежденным крылом.  -- Рон, заходи сзади -- Гермиона, подстрахуй снизу и не дай ему ускользнуть -- я попытаюсь схватить  его. ПОШЛИ!       Рон поднырнул, Гермиона налетела снизу, ключ обошел их обоих, и Гарри рванулся за ним; ключ  тюкнулся об стенку, Гарри подался вперед и с неприятным хрустящим звуком прижал его одной рукой  к камню. Аплодисменты Рона и Гермионы эхом отразились от потолка.       Они быстренько приземлились и Гарри побежал к двери, с трепыхающимся в руке ключом. Он  сунул его в скважину и повернул -- работает. В момент, когда замок, открывшись, щелкнул, ключ  вырвался и улетел, выглядя после второй поимки довольно потрепанным.       -- Готовы? -- спросил Гарри остальных, не отнимая руки от дверной ручки. Те кивнули. Он толкнул  дверь.       В следующей комнате было темно и ничего не видно. Но как только они шагнули туда, неожиданно  вспыхнул свет, озарив удивительную картину.       Они стояли на краю огромной шахматной доски, за черными фигурами, которые были выше их  ростом и казались высеченными из чего-то, напоминающего черный камень. Напротив них, в другом  конце комнаты, стояли белые фигуры. Гарри, Рон и Гермиона слегка поежились -- у огромных белых  фигур не было лиц.       -- И что теперь нам делать? -- прошептал Гарри.       -- Разве не ясно? -- удивился Рон. -- Мы должны, играя, пройти через комнату.        За белыми фигурами виднелась следующая дверь.       -- Но как? -- нервно спросила Гермиона.       -- Думаю, -- сказал Рон. -- мы должны стать фигурами.       Он подошел к черному коню и дотронулся до него. Камень тотчас же ожил. Лошадь забила  копытом, а всадник повернул голову в шлеме и взглянул на Рона.       -- Можно нам -- э-э -- присоединиться к вам в игре?       Черный всадник кивнул. Рон обернулся к остальным.        -- Тут надо поразмыслить... -- сказал он. -- Полагаю, нам надо занять место каких-то трех фигур...       Гарри и Гермиона стояли, не шевелясь, глядя, как Рон размышляет. Наконец он сказал:       -- Вы только не обижайтесь, но оба вы в шахматах не сильны.       -- Мы не обидимся, -- быстро ответил Гарри. -- Ты только говори нам, что делать.       -- Так, Гарри, займи место этого слона, а ты, Гермиона, иди за ним и встань вместо ладьи.

Мужчины-гомосексуалисты, скрывающие от других свою гомосексуальность, более  подвержены различным инфекционным заболеваниям (по: Cole et al.,1996).    С другой стороны, открытое обсуждение своих отрицательных эмоций и важных вопросов,  касающихся собственной жизни, по-видимому, положительно влияет на здоровье. В ходе  широкомасштабной серии исследований Пеннбэйкер (Pennebaker, 1990) обнаружил, что следование  рекомендациям описывать свои личные травмы в дневниках или эссе положительно влияет на  здоровье. Так, в одном из этих исследований 50 здоровых студентов старших курсов были  произвольным образом распределены по группам, которым было дано задание описывать либо  наиболее травматические и неприятные события из своей жизни, либо свои мысли на отвлеченные  темы по 20 минут в течение четырех дней. У испытуемых были взяты пробы крови в день,  предшествующий началу выполнения задания, и в последний день выполнения задания, а также через  шесть недель после окончания эксперимента, и проанализированы по ряду показателей  функционирования иммунной системы. Также регистрировалось число случаев обращения этих  студентов в медицинский центр их колледжа и сравнивалось с числом их обращений в центр до  начала эксперимента. Как видно из рис. 14.7, студенты, описывавшие свои личные травмы, показали  более позитивные результаты анализа иммунной системы и реже посещали медицинский центр, чем  студенты из контрольной группы (Pennebaker, Kiecolt-Glaser & Glaser, 1988).

psych.pdf,ru,453,"Из закона сохранения энергии следует, что если подавлять запрещенное действие или импульс,  его энергия будет искать выход где-то еще в этой системе и, возможно, проявится в замаскированном  виде. В желаниях «оно» заключена психическая энергия, которая должна быть выражена каким-то  образом, и запрещение выражать ее не отменяет эти желания. Агрессивные импульсы, например,  могут замещаться соревнованием на спортивных машинах, игрой в шахматы или саркастическим  чувством юмора. Мечты и невротические симптомы также являются проявлениями психической  энергии, прямому выходу которой помешали.  Тревожность и защита. Индивиды, у которых есть стремление сделать что-то запрещенное,  переживают тревогу. Один из путей снижения тревожности — выразить импульс в замаскированном  виде, так чтобы избежать наказания либо со стороны общества, либо со стороны его внутреннего  представителя — суперэго. Фрейд описал еще несколько стратегий, при помощи которых индивид  может снять или уменьшить тревожность. Эти стратегии называются механизмами защиты эго.  Наиболее элементарный механизм защиты — подавление, при котором эго вытесняет угрожающую  мысль или запрещенный импульс из сознания в бессознательное; извне кажется, что человек просто  забыл эту мысль или импульс. Индивиды различаются как по порогу тревожности, так и по способам  защиты от нее. Тревожность и механизмы защиты от нее занимают центральное место во  фрейдовской теории психопатологии и будут рассмотрены подробнее в главе 14, посвященной  стрессу и способам с ним справиться.    Развитие личности    Фрейд полагал, что в течение первых 5 лет жизни индивид проходит несколько этапов  развития, влияющих на его личность. Исходя из широкого определения сексуальности, он назвал эти  периоды психосексуальными стадиями. На каждой из них исходящие от «оно» импульсы к поиску  удовольствия сосредоточиваются на определенном участке тела и на действиях, относящихся к этому  участку.  Первый год жизни Фрейд называл оральной стадией психосексуального развития. В течение  этого периода младенец получает удовольствие от кормления грудью и сосания и начинает класть в  рот все, до чего может дотянуться. Второй год жизни Фрейд считал началом анальной стадии и  полагал, что в это время дети находят удовольствие в удержании и выбросе фекалий. Эти  удовольствия вступают в противоречие с родителями, пытающимися научить их ходить в туалет;  здесь ребенок впервые знакомится с навязанным контролем. Во время фаллической стадии, длящейся  примерно от 3 до 6 лет, дети начинают получать удовольствие от ласкания своих гениталий. Они  наблюдают разницу между мужчинами и женщинами и начинают направлять свои пробуждающиеся  сексуальные импульсы на родителя противоположного пола.  Именно на фаллической стадии ребенку предстоит разрешить эдипов конфликт. Наиболее  четко Фрейд описал этот конфликт на примере мальчиков. Примерно в возрасте 5-6 лет сексуальные  импульсы мальчика направлены на мать. Это заставляет его видеть в отце соперника в своей  привязанности к матери. Эту ситуацию Фрейд назвал эдиповым конфликтом — по пьесе Софокла, в  которой царь Эдип по неведению убил своего отца и женился на своей матери. Согласно Фрейду,  мальчик также боится, что его отец отплатит ему за эти импульсы, кастрировав его. Фрейд назвал это  беспокойство страхом кастрации и считал его прототипом всех более поздних видов тревожности,  вызванной  запрещенными  внутренними  желаниями.  При  нормальном  развитии  мальчик  одновременно снижает эту тревожность, косвенно удовлетворяя свои чувства к матери путем  идентификации  себя  с  отцом;  идентификация  осуществляется  путем  интернализации  идеализированных восприятий склонностей и ценностей своего отца. У девочки такой же процесс  идентификации со своей матерью протекает аналогично, но он сложнее и даже более противоречив.    ",3837,2410,,

Схематическое строение среднего и внутреннего уха. а) Движения жидкости  внутри улитки изгибают базилярную мембрану и стимулируют волосяные клетки, служащие  слуховыми рецепторами, б) На поперечном сечении улитки показана базилярная мембрана и  волосяные клетки-рецепторы.    Теперь рассмотрим систему преобразования. Улитка — это спиралевидная трубка из костного  вещества. Мембраны разделяют ее на секции, заполненные жидкостью; одна из мембран —  базилярная, к ней прикреплены слуховые рецепторы (см. рис, 4.25). Эти рецепторы называются  волосяными клетками, потому что по строению они похожи на волоски, проникающие в жидкость.  Давление на овальном окошечке (соединяющем среднее и внутреннее ухо) создает изменения  давления жидкости в улитке, что, в свою очередь, заставляет базилярную мембрану вибрировать,  приводя к изгибанию волосяных клеток и появлению электрического импульса. Таков сложный  процесс преобразования звуковой волны в электрический импульс. Нейроны, синаптически  соединенные с нервными клетками, имеют длинные аксоны, которые образуют часть слухового  нерва. Большинство слуховых нейронов соединены с отдельными нервными клетками. В слуховом  нерве около 31 000 слуховых нейронов, что гораздо меньше одного миллиона нейронов,  составляющих зрительный нерв (Yost & Nielson, 1985). От каждого уха слуховые пути идут к обеим  сторонам мозга и заканчиваются на синапсах различных ядер, прежде чем достигают слуховой коры.    Восприятие интенсивности звука    Вспомним, что наше зрение более чувствительно к одним длинам волн, чем к другим. В  слуховом восприятии есть аналогичное явление. Человек более чувствителен к звукам в середине  частотного диапазона, чем к звукам с частотой ближе к его краям. Это показано на рис. 4.26, где  приведена зависимость абсолютного порога интенсивности звука от частоты. У многих людей слух в  той или иной степени ослаблен, и порог у них выше того, что показан на рис. 4.26.    ",1952,1601,,

Эта кривая забывания, первая из когда-либо опубликованных,  взята из работы Эббингауза 1885 года. Он заучивал списки из 13 слогов, которые повторял, пока не  был способен воспроизвести список без ошибок в двух последовательных попытках. Затем, по  прошествии времени от 20 минут до 31 дня, он себя проверял, определяя, сколько времени уходит на  перезаучивание этого списка относительно первоначального уровня; чем меньше было забывание,  тем меньше требовалось попыток на перезаучивание списка. На рисунке показана мера легкости  перезаучиваний (доля «сохраненных элементов») в зависимости от времени; из рисунка следует, что  мы забываем много информации за первые несколько часов, но после этого темп забывания  снижается. Эта кривая отражает запоминание бессвязного вербального материала, а для других  видов материала были получены другие кривые (см., например: Bahrick & Phelphs, 1987). Во всех  случаях интерференция, как полагают, играет определенную роль в изменении забывания со  временем.  ",1121,1092,,

Между ними есть два существенных различия, объясняющие ряд явлений,  связанных с восприятием интенсивности, или яркости. Первое различие состоит в том, что в среднем  одна ганглиозная клетка соединена с большим количеством палочек, чем колбочек; поэтому  «палочковые» ганглиозные клетки имеют больше входов, чем «колбочковые». Второе различие  состоит в том, что палочки и колбочки размещены на сетчатке по-разному. В зоне фовеа много  колбочек, но нет палочек, а на периферии много палочек, но относительно мало колбочек. Из-за того,  что ганглиозная клетка соединена с большим количеством палочек, чем колбочек, палочковое зрение  оказывается более чувствительным, чем колбочковое.

В левой части рисунка изображены три соседних колбочки, каждая из которых  подсоединена (не непосредственно) к одной ганглиозной клетке; в правой части рисунка показаны  три соседних палочки, которые все подсоединены (не непосредственно) к одной ганглиозной клетке.

Хотя наиболее очевидный путь изучения культурных различий — это исследование обычаев  разных стран, можно понаблюдать и за культурными изменениями, происходящими в одной стране.  Такие изменения происходили, например, в Соединенных Штатах и других западных странах с 40-х  по 70-е годы. В 40-х и 50-х годах Соединенные Штаты и большинство других западных стран можно  было отнести к числу стран с сильными сексуальными ограничениями. По традиции, сексуальные  проявления до пубертатного периода здесь игнорировались или отрицались. Секс в браке считался  единственным законным видом секса, а другие его проявления (гомосексуализм, добрачный и  внебрачный секс) в целом осуждались и часто запрещались законом. Конечно, многие члены этих  обществ вступали в такого рода отношения, но часто с ощущением стыда.  Со временем сексуальная деятельность стала меньше ограничиваться. Добрачные связи,  например, стали считаться более приемлемыми и встречаться чаще. Среди американских учащихся  колледжей, проинтервьюированных в 40-х годах, 27% женщин и 49% мужчин участвовали в  добрачных сексуальных отношениях к возрасту 21 год (Kinsey et al., 1953; Kinsey, Pomeroy & Martin,  1948). В отличие от этого, несколько опросов американских студентов колледжей, проведенных в 70- х годах, показали соответствующий процент от 40% до 80% и у мужчин, и у женщин (Tavris & Sadd,  1977; Hunt, 1974). В последние десятилетия наблюдается постепенная тенденция к снижению  возраста начала сексуальных отношений. Примерно 50% и мужчин и женщин сообщают о наличии у  них сексуальных отношений в возрасте 16-17 лет (Laumann et al., 1994).

Гештальт-детерминанты группировки. а) Точки, расположенные на равных  расстояниях, могут зрительно восприниматься как ряды, колонки и даже диагонали. б) Группировка  в колонки по смежности. в) Группировка в колонки по цветовому сходству. г) Группировка в колонки  по сходству формы. д) Группировка по (вероятному) продолжению. е) Группировка по замыканию  (контура).    Гештальт-психологи предложили ряд детерминант, определяющих группировку такого рода  точечных паттернов. Например, если сократить расстояния между точками по вертикали, как на рис.  5.6б, вы скорее всего будете видеть колонки. Такой тип группировки называется группировкой по  смежности. Если вместо изменения расстояний между точками мы изменим цвет или форму  элементов, мы получим организацию точек на основе сходства (рис. 5.6в, г). Если мы переместим  точки так, чтобы они располагались вдоль двух пересекающихся линий, мы получим группировку по  вероятному продолжению (рис. 5.6д). А если мы с помощью линий, состоящих из точек, оградим  замкнутое пространство, мы будем видеть группировку по замыканию (рис. 5.6е). Обратите  внимание, что в последнем случае мы видим ромб, ограниченный двумя линиями, несмотря на то что  данный паттерн может быть описан как хорошо знакомая нам буква М, отраженная зеркально по  вертикали, или как буква К, отраженная по горизонтали. Этот факт свидетельствует о значительном  влиянии гештальт-детерминант. Такие детерминанты помогают нам образовывать наиболее  стабильные, согласованные и простые формы, возможные в рамках данного паттерна.  Современные исследования визуальной группировки показывают, что гештальт-детерминанты  оказывают сильное влияние на восприятие. Так, например, в одной серии исследований визуальные  цели, являвшиеся частью более крупных паттернов, основанных на смежности, было значительно  сложнее обнаружить, чем те же формы, воспринимающиеся как расположенные отдельно от общей  группы (Banks & Prinzmetal, 1976; Prinzmetal, 1981). В другой серии исследований цели,  отличающиеся по форме и цвету от нецелевых изображений, оказалось легче обнаружить, чем более  сходные с ними (Triesman, 1986). Даже сходство между различными нецелевыми изображениями  оказывает значительное влияние: цели тем легче обнаружить, чем больше сходство между  нецелевыми изображениями, что заставляет цели «выскакивать» из фона, как отличные от него  (Duncan & Humphreys, 1989). Наконец, существуют стойкие иллюзии, связанные с гештальт- детерминантами; например, люди оценивают расстояния между элементами, составляющими  визуальные группы, как меньшие, чем расстояния между элементами, принадлежащими к различным  группам (Coren & Girgus, 1980; Enns & Girgus, 1985). Все эти данные свидетельствуют о том, что  визуальная группировка играет важную роль в организации нашего визуального опыта.  ",2823,1914,,
psych.pdf,ru,293,"Фрейд считал, что некоторые эмоциональные переживания в детстве являются настолько  травмирующими, что позволить им войти в сознание многие годы спустя означало бы для индивида  стать совершенно раздавленным беспокойством (это отличается от примера с экзаменом, где  беспокойство терпимо для сознания). Говорят, что такие травмирующие переживания хранятся в  бессознательном или что они подавлены и воспроизвести их можно только при частичном  сглаживании связанных с ними эмоций. Подавление, таким образом, представляет собой полную  невозможность воспроизведения: доступ к требуемым воспоминаниям здесь блокируется активно.  Понятие активной блокировки качественно отличает гипотезу подавления от представлений о  забывании, рассмотренных выше. (Обсуждение теории Фрейда см. в гл. 13.)  Подавление — настолько поразительное явление, что его, конечно, хотелось бы изучить в  лаборатории, но оказалось, что сделать это трудно. Чтобы вызвать в лабораторных условиях истинное  подавление, экспериментатору пришлось бы подвергнуть испытуемого какому-нибудь чрезвычайно  травматичному переживанию; этого нельзя делать по этическим соображениям. Поэтому в  проводившихся исследованиях испытуемые подвергались только умеренным расстройствам. Данные  этих исследований неоднозначны по отношению к гипотезе подавления (Baddeley, 1990; Erdelyi,  1985).  В целом долговременная память является системой, способной хранить информацию на  протяжении многих дней, лет и даже десятилетий, как правило, в форме, закодированной в  соответствии с ее смыслом, хотя возможны и другие коды. Извлечение информации из данной  системы в значительной степени подвержено интерференции; во многих случаях «потеря памяти» в  действительности представляет собой не что иное, как проблемы извлечения. Хранение информации  в системе долговременной памяти предполагает процесс консолидации — процесс, опосредуемый  системой гиппокампа. На многие аспекты долговременной памяти оказывают влияние эмоции; эти  влияния могут отражать такие процессы, как избирательная репетиция, интерференция при  извлечении, эффекты контекста, либо такие специфические механизмы, как вспышки воспоминаний и  вытеснение.      Имплицитная память    До сих пор мы в основном затрагивали ситуации, в которых люди помнили факты личной  жизни. В таких случаях память выступает как сознательное восстановление прошлого, и о таких  воспоминаниях говорят, что они выражены эксплицитно. Но существует и другой вид памяти,  который проявляет себя в навыках и выражается в совершенном выполнении некоторых  перцептивных, моторных или когнитивных задач без сознательного восстановления того опыта,  который привел к такому совершенству. Например, по мере тренировки мы можем устойчиво  улучшать свою способность к распознаванию слов иностранного языка, но в момент, когда мы  распознаем слово и тем самым демонстрируем наш навык, не требуются какие-либо сознательные  воспоминания об уроках, приведших к улучшенному знанию. Здесь память выражена имплицитно  (Schacter, 1989).  <Рис. Память на такие навыки, как завязывание шнурков, называется имплицитной  памятью.>    Память при амнезии    Многое об имплицитной памяти удалось узнать благодаря людям, страдающим амнезией.  Амнезией называют частичную потерю памяти. Она может возникать по очень разным причинам,  включая случайное повреждение мозга, удары головой, ушибы, энцефалиты, алкоголизм,  электросудорожную терапию и хирургическое вмешательство (например, удаление гиппокампа с  целью уменьшить проявления эпилепсии). Какова бы ни была ее причина, первичным симптомом  амнезии является основательная неспособность помнить текущие события и, следовательно,  приобретать новое фактическое знание; это называют антероградной амнезией, и она может быть  обширной. Существует один хорошо наблюдаемый пациент Н. А., который неспособен вести  обычный разговор, поскольку при малейшем отвлечении он теряет нить мысли. Другой пациент — Г.  М., которого наблюдают дольше всех остальных больных амнезией, — читает снова и снова одни и те  же журналы, и его постоянно надо заново знакомить с врачами, которые лечат его десятилетиями.

psych.pdf,ru,244,"    В течение первых часов после пробуждения сонливость постепенно снижается. Это явление  называется инерцией сна. Впоследствии потребность в сне остается более или менее устойчивой до  момента, вплотную приближенного к привычному времени сна, а затем внезапно увеличивается. В  течение последующих 8-9 часов сонливость продолжает нарастать и достигает своего пика около 8-10  часов утра. На второй день бодрствования сонливость незначительно уменьшается. Обратите  внимание, что температура тела при этом имеет очень устойчивый суточный ритм, а нижняя точка  тревожности достигается только после достижения нижних значений температуры тела, которые у  здоровых молодых людей проявляются в 6 утра, то есть близко к обычному времени пробуждения.  Данные показывают, что после ночи без сна мы чувствуем себя более сонными. Это происходит из-за  процесса, называемого гомеостазом сна, который отслеживает, сколько мы спали и как долго были  активны. Время дня или, точнее, суточные часы также влияют на потребность в сне.  Описанное нами 40-часовое бодрствование включает в себя два процесса — гомеостаз сна  (время активности) и суточный цикл (объективное время). Их одновременное изменение и  взаимодействие невозможно измерить количественно. Чтобы все же определять эти взаимодействия,  исследователи использовали форсированный несинхронный протокол, в котором цикл сна/  бодрствования десинхронизированно связывался с эндогенным суточным циклом при помощи  графика. Ежедневно они подавали сигналы о наступлении времени сна и времени пробуждения на  четыре часа позже, как если бы сутки длились не 24, а 28 часов. Суточный цикл не может быть  синхронизирован с предложенным 28-часовым периодом, и эпизоды сна и бодрствования, таким  образом, будут проявляться в разное время суток. Поэтому в один из «дней» активный период  начнется в низшей температурной точке, в другие «дни» это произойдет близко к температурному  пику и т. д. Теперь мы можем наблюдать фактически каждую комбинацию времени активности и  суточную стадию, количественно определяя взаимодействие суточного и гомеостазного процессов.  Суточный ритм потребности в сне достигает своего пика рано утром, близко к обычному  времени пробуждения, и опускается до низших значений в вечерние часы, близко к обычному  времени отхода ко сну. Кроме того, показано, что гомеостазный позыв ко сну возрастает достаточно  быстро даже в пределах нормального диапазона продолжительности бодрствования, то есть 0-18  часов. На протяжении обычного периода бодрствования мы не ощущаем увеличения позыва ко сну.  Нелинейное взаимодействие между этими двумя процессами таково, что в течение первых 16 часов  активного времени суток, начинающегося где-то около 7 часов утра, последовательное увеличение  гомеостазной потребности в сне возмещается последовательным сокращением суточного позыва ко  сну. Это отлично срабатывает до тех пор, пока стадии цикла сна/бодрствования и суточного цикла  совпадают. Проблемы возникают, когда соотношение стадий изменяется, например, при работе в  ночную смену. Рабочий ночной смены пробуждается примерно после полудня и идет на работу к 11  часам вечера. Он превосходно чувствует себя, потому что вел активный образ жизни всего лишь 10  часов и суточные часы все еще не заставляют его думать о сне, но напротив, принуждают  бодрствовать. Однако на протяжении ночи суточный позыв к увеличению потребности в сне будет  усиливаться, так же как и гомеостазный позыв ко сну. К 6 часам утра гомеостазное увеличение  позыва ко сну будет возрастать уже в течение 17 часов, поэтому суточные часы максимально  продлевают сон. Неудивительно, что рабочий ночной смены теперь уже очень хочет спать и сонный  направляется домой.  ",3699,2316,,

В  эксперименте участвовало 491 испытуемых, и график показывает количество испытуемых для  каждого количества забытых элементов.

Под действием гипнотического внушения некоторые испытуемые  способны вновь пережить эпизоды из ранних периодов своей жизни, например празднование дня  рождения в 10 лет. Для некоторых испытуемых такие эпизоды отображаются как бы на телеэкране;  они сознают, что присутствуют и видят происходящее, но не ощущают, что это они создают его. При  другом типе регрессии испытуемые чувствуют, что как бы заново переживают эти события. Они  могут описать одежду, которую они носят, провести рукой по волосам и описать их длину или узнать  одноклассников из начальной школы. Изредка во время регрессии появляется давно забытый язык,  которым испытуемый пользовался в детстве. Например, родившийся в Америке мальчик, родители  которого японцы и который говорил по-японски в раннем возрасте, но потом забыл этот язык, под  гипнозом снова начал говорить на нем (Fromm, 1970).  Позитивные и негативные галлюцинации. Для получения одних гипнотических ощущений  требуется больший гипнотический талант, чем для других.

Различают два типа  внушенных галлюцинаций: позитивные галлюцинации, при которых испытуемый видит объект или  слышит голос, которого в действительности нет, и негативные галлюцинации, при которых  испытуемый не воспринимает что-то, что он воспринял бы при нормальных условиях. У многих  галлюцинаций есть и позитивные, и негативные компоненты. Чтобы не видеть человека, сидящего на  стуле (негативная галлюцинация), испытуемый должен видеть части стула, закрытые от взгляда  сидящим (позитивная галлюцинация).  Галлюцинации могут также появляться в результате постгипнотического внушения. Например,  испытуемым можно сказать, что после выхода из гипнотического состояния они обнаружат, что  держат кролика, который хочет, чтобы его приласкали, и будет спрашивать «Который час?». Видение  и ласкание кролика большинству испытуемых будет казаться натуральным. Но когда они  обнаруживают, что сообщают правильно время и день, они удивляются и пытаются объяснить свое  поведение; «Я слышал, кто-то спрашивал у меня время? Забавно, мне показалось, что спрашивал  кролик, но ведь кролики не говорят!» — это типичная реакция.  Негативные галлюцинации могут эффективно применяться для контроля боли. Во многих  случаях гипноз снимает боль, несмотря на то что ее источник — сильный ожог или перелом кости —  остался. Невозможность воспринять что-либо (боль), что было бы воспринято при нормальных  условиях, квалифицирует эту реакцию как негативную галлюцинацию. Для болеутоляющего эффекта  гипноза снятие боли не обязательно должно быть полным. Уменьшение боли на 20% может сделать  жизнь пациента более терпимой. Экспериментальные исследования показали, что степень снижения  боли тесно связана с измеряемой величиной гипнабельности (Crasilneck & Hall, 1985; Hilgard &  Hilgard, 1975).    ",3525,2248,,

Психологические исследования свидетельствуют о том, что просмотр телепередач,  содержащих сцены насилия, оказывает негативное влияние на маленьких зрителей.>      Исторические основания психологии    Современная психология уходит своими корнями к философии IV-V веков до нашей эры.  Великие греческие философы Сократ, Платон и Аристотель поставили фундаментальные вопросы о  психической жизни человека. Например: верно ли люди воспринимают реальность? Что такое  сознание? Является ли человек изначально рациональным или иррациональным существом? Обладает  ли человек свободой выбора? Эти вопросы, такие же важные сегодня, как и две тысячи лет назад,  обращены скорее к природе разума и психических процессов, чем к природе тела или поведения и  являются предшественниками когнитивного подхода.  <Рис. Древнегреческий философ Сократ поставил перед человечеством фундаментальные  вопросы, касающиеся психической жизни. Многие из этих вопросов столь же актуальны сегодня, как  и в его эпоху.>  У биологического подхода — не менее долгая история. Гиппократ, считающийся «отцом  медицины» и живший примерно в то же время, что и Сократ, весьма интересовался физиологией  (отрасль биологии, изучающая нормальные функции живого организма и его органов). Он сделал  много важных наблюдений о том, как мозг контролирует различные органы тела, заложив тем самым  фундамент физиологического и биологического подходов в современной психологии.

Существование и акустических, и зрительных кодов  привело исследователей к мнению, что кратковременная память состоит из двух хранилищ, или  буферов. Один буфер — акустический, на короткое время сохраняющий информацию в акустических  кодах; второе хранилище — зрительно-пространственный буфер, на короткое время сохраняющий  информацию в зрительных или пространственных кодах (Baddeley, 1986). Некоторые недавние  исследования с использованием сканеров мозга показывают, что работа этих двух буферов  опосредуется различными мозговыми структурами.  В одном эксперименте испытуемые в каждой пробе видели последовательность букв, в  которой название и положение буквы менялись от элемента к элементу (рис. 8.3). В некоторых  пробах испытуемым надо было обращать внимание только на название буквы, и перед ними  ставилась задача определить, совпадает ли каждая предъявляемая буква с той, что предъявлялась на  три буквы раньше в этой последовательности. В других попытках испытуемым надо было обращать  внимание только на пространственное положение букв, а задача заключалась в том, чтобы  определить, совпадает ли положение каждой предъявляемой буквы с положением буквы,  предъявленной на три позиции раньше (см. рис. 8.3).

Поскольку поддержание температуры тела — решающий фактор выживания, важно, чтобы мы  могли чувствовать небольшие изменения температуры кожи. При нормальной температуре кожи  человек может обнаружить потепление всего на 0,4 градуса или похолодание всего на 0,15 градусов  (Kenshalo, Nafe & Brooks, 1961). Температурное чувство человека полностью адаптируется к  умеренным изменениям температуры, так что через несколько минут стимул уже не ощущается ни  как холодный, ни как теплый. Такой адаптацией объясняются сильные расхождения во мнениях о  температуре воды в бассейне между теми, кто в нем уже какое-то время побыл, и теми, кто только  начал болтать ногами в воде.  <Рис. После пребывания какое-то время в бассейне ощущение температуры адаптируется к  ее изменению. Но когда мы сначала болтаем ногами в воде, то обнаруживаем, что вода холоднее.>    Боль    Ни одно другое чувство не овладевает настолько нашим вниманием, как боль. Испытывая  другие ощущения, мы часто пресыщаемся ими, но ощущение боли трудно игнорировать. И все-таки,  несмотря на весь причиняемый ею дискомфорт, надо признать, что не будь чувства боли, мы  подвергались бы большому риску. Детям трудно было бы научиться не трогать горячую печь или  перестать жевать свой язык. На самом деле есть люди, родившиеся с редким генетическим  нарушением, из-за которого они нечувствительны к боли. Как правило, они умирают молодыми  вследствие порчи тканей организма и ран, которых можно было бы избежать, будь у них чувство  боли.  Болевая система. Всякий раздражитель, достаточно сильный, чтобы вызвать повреждение  тканей, является стимулом боли. Это может быть давление, температура, удар электрическим током  или едкие химикалии. Эффект этого стимула достигается посредством высвобождения содержащихся  в коже химических веществ, которые в свою очередь стимулируют различные рецепторы с высоким  порогом возбуждения (этап превращения). Такими рецепторами являются нейроны с особыми  свободными нервными окончаниями; известно несколько таких рецепторов (Brown & Deffenbacher,  1979).  Что касается вариаций качества боли, то наиболее важное различие относится к двум ее  состояниям: тому, которое мы чувствуем непосредственно в момент получения раны (фазическая  боль), и тому, которое переживается после ранения (тоническая боль). Фазическая боль — это обычно  резкая непосредственная боль, непродолжительная по длительности (ее интенсивность быстро растет  и падает), а тоническая боль, как правило, тупая и длится долго.  Например, если вам случится вывихнуть себе лодыжку, то вы тут же почувствуете резкую  волнообразную (фазическую) боль, но чуть погодя вы начнете чувствовать устойчивую (тоническую)  боль, вызванную распуханием. Эти два вида боли передаются двумя различными нервными путями,  ведущими к различным участкам коры мозга (Melzak, 1990).  Внестимульные детерминанты боли. На интенсивность и качество боли больше, чем на любое  другое ощущение, влияют факторы иные, чем непосредственный стимул. К этим факторам относятся  культурная принадлежность человека, его ожидания и предшествующий опыт. Поразительным  примером культурного влияния служит то, что в некоторых незападных обществах существуют  ритуалы, кажущиеся  впервые  столкнувшемуся с  ними  западному  человеку  невыносимо  болезненными. К таковым относится церемония подвешивания на крюках, практикуемая в некоторых  районах Индии:  «Эта церемония ведет начало от древнего обычая, в котором выбирали члена социальной  группы, чтобы он представлял собой силу богов. Роль избранного (или ""священника"") заключалась в  том, чтобы в определенный период года благословить детей и урожай в ряде соседствующих  деревень. В этом ритуале примечательно то, что по обеим сторонам спины этого человека под кожей  и мышцами продеваются стальные крюки, привязанные крепкими веревками к верхушке специальной  телеги (см. рис. 4.29).

Из этих исследований следует  вывод, что наблюдение за живыми моделями агрессии либо за изображенными в фильме повышает  вероятность агрессии со стороны наблюдателя. Возможно, это частично объясняет, почему у детей,  которых родители строго наказывали, агрессивность выше средней: моделью служили родители  (Eron, 1987).    ",2166,1655,,
psych.pdf,ru,46,"Нервная система, органы чувств, мышцы и железы позволяют нам осознавать окружающий  мир и приспосабливаться к нему. Восприятие событий зависит от того, как наши органы чувств  обнаруживают стимулы и как информация от них интерпретируется мозгом. Поведение человека во  многом мотивируется такими потребностями, как голод, жажда и избегание усталости и боли.  Способность человека пользоваться речью, мыслить и решать проблемы зависит от работы мозга,  который невероятно сложен. Действительно, основу сложнейших мыслительных процессов  составляют определенные совокупности электрических и химических явлений в мозге.  В сущности, любые аспекты поведения и психического функционирования легче понять, зная  о том, какие биологические процессы лежат в их основе. При рассмотрении восприятия, мотивации и  речи в различных частях этой книги мы будем более подробно останавливаться на  нейробиологических механизмах. В задачу настоящей главы не входит подробный обзор  взаимоотношений биологии и психологии; мы лишь предварительно ознакомимся с некоторыми  основными идеями нейробиологии, которые позднее, при обсуждении различных психологических  явлений, будут представлены более развернуто.      Нейроны - строительные блоки нервной системы    Основной единицей нервной системы является нейрон — специализированная клетка,  передающая нервные импульсы или сигналы другим нейронам, железам и мышцам. Понимать работу  нейронов важно потому, что, без сомнения, именно в них таятся секреты функционирования мозга и,  соответственно, секреты человеческого сознания. Нам известна их роль в передаче нервных  импульсов, и мы знаем, как работают некоторые нервные механизмы; но мы только начинаем  узнавать об их более сложных функциях в процессах памяти, эмоций и мышления.  В нервной системе существует два типа нейронов: очень мелкие нейроны, известные как  локальные нейроны, и более крупные нейроны, называемые макронейронами. Хотя большинство  нейронов являются локальными, мы лишь недавно начали понимать, как они функционируют.  Фактически на протяжении долгого времени многие исследователи полагали, что эти крохотные  нейроны вовсе не являются нейронами или что они являются незрелыми и неспособными к передаче  информации. Сегодня мы знаем, что на самом деле локальные нейроны передают сигналы другим  нейронам. Однако они обмениваются сигналами преимущественно с соседними нейронами и не  передают информацию на большие расстояния в пределах организма, как это делают макронейроны.  С другой стороны, макронейроны были детально изучены, и поэтому наше внимание будет  сосредоточено на этих нейронах. Хотя макронейроны значительно различаются по своим размерам и  внешнему виду, все они обладают некоторыми общими характеристиками (см. рис. 2.1) От тела  клетки отходит множество коротких отростков, называемых дендритами (от греческого дендрон —  дерево). К дендритам и телу клетки поступают нервные импульсы от соседних нейронов. Эти  сообщения передаются другим нейронам (или мышцам и железам) через тонкое трубчатое удлинение  клетки, которое называется аксоном. Окончание аксона делится на ряд тонких веточек, разветвлений,  на концах которых имеются небольшие утолщения, называемые синаптическими окончаниями.    ",3221,2134,,
psych.pdf,ru,189,"Хотя вышеуказанный эффект проявляется при обычных обстоятельствах, изменения в  окружении могут разрушить его. Представьте, что черная рубашка расположена за черным  непрозрачным экраном и вы разглядываете ее через глазок в экране. Экран с отверстием ограничивает  видимую область, так что вы видите только свет, отраженный от самой рубашки, независимо от ее  окружения. Теперь, когда рубашка освещена, она будет выглядеть белой, поскольку свет,  достигающий вашего глаза через отверстие, имеет большую интенсивность, чем отраженный от  самого экрана. Из этого примера можно понять, почему яркость объекта обычно остается неизменной.  Когда мы воспринимаем объект в естественной ситуации, обычно видны и несколько других  объектов. Константность яркости зависит от соотношения интенсивностей света, отраженного от  различных объектов. Так, черный бархат обычно продолжает видеться черным даже на солнце  потому, что он все равно отражает меньше света, чем окружающие его предметы. Именно  относительной величиной отраженного света определяется его яркость (Gilchrist, 1978).  С цветом все примерно так же. Тенденция к сохранности цвета объекта при освещении его  различными источниками света называется константностью цвета. Как и константность яркости,  константность цвета можно нарушить, удалив объект из его фона. Например, если смотреть на зрелый  помидор через трубку, скрывающую и окружение, и общий вид самого объекта, он может оказаться  любого цвета — синего, зеленого или розового — в зависимости от длин волн отраженного от него  света. Поэтому константность цвета, как и константность яркости, зависит от неоднородности фона  (Maloney & Wandell, 1986; Land, 1977).

И несмотря на все это, мы при открывании двери воспринимаем ее  без изменений. Сохранение постоянства воспринимаемой формы при изменении изображения на  сетчатке является примером константности формы.    ",2327,1618,,

psych.pdf,ru,61,"  Рис. 2.13. Специализация функций коры левого полушария. Большая часть коры  ответственна за генерацию движений и анализ сенсорных сигналов. Соответствующие зоны  (включая моторную, соматосенсорную, зрительную, слуховую и обонятельную) имеются на обоих  полушариях. Некоторые функции представлены только на одной стороне мозга. Например, зона  Брока и зона Вернике, участвующие в порождении и понимании речи, а также угловая извилина,  соотносящая зрительную и слуховую формы слова, имеются только на левой стороне человеческого  мозга.    Первичная соматосенсорная зона. В теменной зоне, отделенной от моторной зоны  центральной бороздой, находится участок, электрическая стимуляция которого вызывает сенсорные  ощущения где-то на противоположной стороне тела. Они похожи на то, как если бы какая-нибудь  часть тела двигалась или до нее дотрагивались. Этот участок называют первичной соматосенсорной  зоной (зоной телесных ощущений). Здесь представлены ощущения холода, прикосновения, боли и  ощущения движений тела.  Большинство нервных волокон в составе путей, идущих к соматосенсорной и моторной зонам  и от них, переходят на противоположную сторону тела. Поэтому сенсорные импульсы с правой  стороны тела идут к левой соматосенсорной коре, а мышцами правой ноги и правой руки управляет  левая моторная кора.  Видимо, можно считать общим правилом, что объем соматосенсорной или моторной зоны,  связанной с определенной частью тела, прямо определяется ее чувствительностью и частотой  использования последней. Например, среди четвероногих млекопитающих у собаки передние лапы  представлены только на очень небольшом участке коры, а у енота, широко пользующегося своими  передними лапами для изучения окружения и манипулирования им, соответствующая зона  значительно шире и в ней есть участки для каждого пальца лапы. У крысы, получающей много  информации об окружении посредством чувствительных усиков, имеется отдельный участок коры  для каждого усика.  Первичная зрительная зона. В задней части каждой затылочной доли есть участок коры,  называемый первичной зрительной зоной. На рис. 2.14 показаны волокна зрительного нерва и  нервные пути, идущие от каждого глаза к зрительной коре. Обратите внимание, что некоторые  зрительные волокна идут от правого глаза к правому полушарию, а некоторые пересекают мозг в так  называемой зрительной хиазме и идут в противоположное полушарие; то же происходит с волокнами  левого глаза. Волокна от правых сторон обоих глаз идут в правое полушарие мозга, а волокна от  левых сторон обоих глаз идут в левое полушарие. Следовательно, повреждение зрительной зоны в  одном полушарии (скажем, в левом) приведет к появлению слепых областей в левой стороне обоих  глаз, что вызовет потерю видимости правой стороны окружения. Этот факт иногда помогает  установить местоположение опухоли мозга и других аномалий.    ",2850,1933,,
psych.pdf,ru,137,"  Призма расщепляет свет на различные длины волн. Короткие волны кажутся синими, средние  — зелеными, а длинные — красными.    В дальнейшем обсуждении цветового восприятия мы будем говорить только о длинах волн.  Это совершенно адекватно в случаях, когда первоисточником ощущения цвета является объект,  излучающий свет, например солнце или лампочка. Однако чаще источником цветовых ощущений  является объект, отражающий свет, когда его освещает источник света. В таких случаях восприятие  цвета объекта частично определяется длинами волн, которые объект отражает, частично — другими  факторами. Один из таких факторов — окружающий цветовой фон. Богатое разнообразие других  цветов в пространственном окружении объекта позволяет наблюдателю правильно воспринимать  цвет объекта, даже когда длины волн, исходящих от объекта и достигающих глаза, не вполне точно  отражают характерный цвет объекта (Land, 1986). Способность воспринимать цвет любимой  джинсовой куртки как индиго, несмотря на значительные вариации окружающего освещения, носит  название «константность цвета». Мы будем более подробно обсуждать эту тему в гл. 5.  Ощущение цвета. В некоторых отношениях ощущение цвета — явление субъективное. Но  для научного изучения цветоощущения нам следует описывать его общепринятыми терминами.  Представим себе пятно света на темном фоне. С феноменологической точки зрения его  характеризуют 3 параметра: светлота, цветовой тон и насыщенность. Светлота показывает, насколько  белым видится свет (ее следует отличать от яркости: очень слабо освещенный объект может тем не  менее казаться белым). Два других параметра относятся непосредственно к самому цвету. Цветовым  тоном называется качество, обозначаемое названием цвета, например «красный» или «зеленовато- желтый». Насыщенность означает наполненность цветом или чистоту цвета. Ненасыщенные цвета  выглядят бледными (например, розовый); насыщенные цвета на вид не содержат белого. Художник  Альберт Манселл предложил схему описания окрашенных поверхностей путем присваивания им  одного из 10 названий цветового тона и двух чисел: одного — для указания насыщенности, другого  — светлоты. Цветовая система Манселла представлена в виде цветового тела (рис. 4.16).    ",2219,1629,,
psych.pdf,ru,49,"  Рис. 2.4. Ионные каналы. Такие химические вещества, как натрий, калий, кальций и хлор,  проходят сквозь клеточную мембрану через торообразные протеиновые молекулы, называемые  ионными каналами.    Нейрон, когда он не передает информацию, называют покоящимся нейроном. В покоящемся  нейроне отдельные протеиновые структуры, называемые ионными насосами, помогают поддерживать  неравномерное распределение различных ионов по клеточной мембране путем перекачивания их  внутрь или вне клетки. Например, ионные насосы транспортируют Na+ за пределы нейрона каждый  раз, когда он проникает в нейрон, и закачивают K+ обратно в нейрон каждый раз, когда он выходит  наружу. Таким образом, у нейрона в состоянии покоя поддерживается высокая концентрация Na+  снаружи и низкая концентрация внутри клетки. Действие этих ионных каналов и насосов создает  поляризацию клеточной мембраны, которая имеет положительный заряд с наружной и  отрицательный заряд с внутренней стороны.  Когда нейрон, находящийся в состоянии покоя, стимулируется, разность потенциалов на  клеточной мембране уменьшается. Если падение напряжения достаточное, натриевые каналы в точке  стимуляции на короткое время открываются и ионы Na+ проникают внутрь клетки. Этот процесс  называется деполяризацией; теперь внутренняя сторона мембраны в этом участке оказывается  заряженной положительно относительно внешней. Соседние натриевые каналы чувствуют это  падение напряжения и в свою очередь открываются, вызывая деполяризацию прилежащих участков.  ",1506,1332,,

На переднем крае психологических исследований    Реакция на плацебо    Плацебо широко применяются при изучении эффективности лекарственных препаратов.  Плацебо — это нейтральное вещество (не оказывающее фармакологического действия), по виду не  отличающееся от настоящего (активного) препарата — по сути, сахарная пилюля. В лекарственных  исследованиях плацебо используются для контроля (а) за ожиданиями пациентов, что лекарство  поможет их самочувствию; (б) за убеждением исследователя, что данное лекарство эффективно; (в) за  благоприятным эффектом повышения внимания сиделок и другого персонала, вызванного тем, что  данный пациент является объектом исследования. Обычно применяется метод двойного неведения:  одна группа пациентов получает настоящий препарат, а другая — плацебо, но ни пациенты, ни  исследователи (или тот, кто оценивает результат) до самого конца исследования не знают, в каких  пилюлях активный препарат, а в каких — плацебо. Поскольку ни пациенты, ни исследователи не  знают содержимого пилюль, эту методику называют двойным неведением. Если показатель  улучшения у тех, кто принимал настоящий препарат, выше, то он считается терапевтически  эффективным. Если у обеих групп наблюдается примерно одинаковое улучшение, значит, какую бы  позитивную реакцию не вызвал прием препарата, считается, что это плацебо-эффект и что сам  препарат неэффективен.  Любые реакции, которые нельзя объяснить исходя из реального действия препарата,  считаются реакциями на плацебо — то есть реакциями, вызванными неизвестными и  нефармакологическими причинами. По общему мнению, такие реакции относят к психологическим.  Плацебо-реакции могут быть очень сильными. Например, 40% пациентов, страдавших от  болезненного сердечного заболевания (стенокардии, или грудной жабы), рассказали о заметном  улучшении самочувствия после диагностической процедуры, которую они считали операцией по  устранению причин заболевания (Beecher, 1961). При лечении психических болезней плацебо часто  не менее эффективны, чем лекарства. Например, в обширном исследовании применения  лекарственной терапии и психотерапии при депрессии обнаружилось, что на таблетку плацебо  пациенты реагировали почти так же хорошо, как и на антидепрессанты или психотерапию (Elkin et al.,  1984).  До начала современной научной медицины практически все лекарства были на самом деле  плацебо. Чтобы излечить болезнь, пациентам давали все мыслимые вещества — крокодилий навоз,  таблетки из высушенной гадюки, семенную жидкость лягушки, пауков, червей и человеческие  экскременты, — приготовленные самыми разнообразными способами. На протяжении всей истории  медицины пациентам давали слабительное, их травили, секли, делали им кровопускание, избивали,  морозили, заставляли потеть и били током (Shapiro & Morris, 1978). Поскольку врачи и лекари  традиционно пользовались почестями и уважением, их «лечение» должно было помогать хотя бы  некоторым пациентам. Их успехи предположительно объясняются реакцией плацебо. Эффектом  плацебо ученые объясняют также документированные случаи исцеления верой и различными  чудесными средствами.  ",4180,2524,,

Эстроген  выделяется в кровоток и влияет на половое развитие тела, а также — у многих видов животных —  активирует половую мотивацию в мозге. Второй гонадотропин, лютеинизирующий гормон,  выделяется гипофизом чуть-чуть позже фолликулостимулирующего гормона. Он вызывает овуляцию  — выход зрелой плодородной яйцеклетки из фолликула. Когда фолликул высвобождает яйцеклетку,  он также выделяет второй женский гормон прогестерон, который подготавливает матку к приему  оплодотворенного яйца и который у некоторых видов животных также активирует сексуальную  мотивацию в мозге.  У мужчин гипоталамус стимулирует выделение гонадотропина постоянно, а не месячными  циклами. Это заставляет мужской гипофиз постоянно выделять в кровоток свой гонадотропин,  называемый промежуточным клеткостимулирующим гормоном (ПКСГ). Под действием ПКСГ  мужские семенники продуцируют зрелые сперматозоиды и резко ускоряют выделение мужских  гормонов, называемых андрогенами, в частности тестостерон. Тестостерон и другие андрогены  стимулируют развитие мужских физических признаков и у большинства видов животных  воздействуют на мозг, активируя половое желание.  Влияние гормонов на желание и возбуждение. Какую роль играют эти гормоны в половом  желании и возбуждении у взрослых? У других видов половое возбуждение тесно связано с  колебаниями уровня гормонов; у человека, однако, роль гормонов меньше. Один из путей оценки  роли гормонов в половом возбуждении — это изучить последствия удаления гонад: яичников или  семенников. Это называется гонадэктомией (у самцов удаление семенников называется кастрацией).  В экспериментах с низшими видами (такими как крысы и морские свинки) кастрация приводит к  быстрому спаду и постепенному исчезновению половой активности. Разумеется, у людей  контролируемых экспериментов не проводится; вместо этого психологи полагаются на наблюдения за  мужчинами с серьезными заболеваниями (например, раком семенников), подвергнувшимися  химической кастрации (введению синтетических гормонов для подавления или блокирования  влияния андрогена). Как правило, эти исследования показывают, что некоторые мужчины теряют  половые интересы, а некоторые продолжают вести нормальную половую жизнь (Walker, 1978; Money  et al., 1976). Видимо, андроген только в некоторых случаях способствует половому желанию.  ",3023,2046,,
psych.pdf,ru,365,"  Из этого следует, что повреждения гипоталамуса на самом деле не устраняют чувство голода.  В действительности они могут опускать или поднимать точку настройки веса, которая обычно  контролирует голод. Изменение точки настройки подобно перестройке термостата: система пытается  достичь нового веса тела. Эффект повреждения вентромедиального гипоталамуса также отвечает  этому представлению. Такие животные не набирают вес до бесконечности. Со временем они  останавливаются на новом, более тяжелом весе. В этой точке они едят ровно столько, сколько нужно  для поддержания новой точки настройки. Но если их посадить на диету, так чтобы их вес упал ниже  новой точки настройки, то затем, когда у них будет возможность, они продолжат переедание (рис.  10.6). А после достижения ими своего уровня тучности переедание снова прекратится.    ",835,979,,

psych.pdf,ru,333,"  Логические правила. В логике наиболее строгие доказательства имеют дедуктивную  достоверность; это означает, что вывод доказательства не может быть ложным, если истинны все его  посылки (Skyrms, 1986). Вот пример такого доказательства:  1. а. Если идет дождь, я возьму зонтик.  б. Идет дождь.  в. Следовательно, я возьму зонтик.  Насколько рассуждения обычных людей соответствуют рассуждениям логика? Когда нас  спрашивают, является ли доказательство дедуктивно достоверным или нет, мы весьма точно  оцениваем простые доказательства. Как мы выносим такого рода суждения? В некоторых теориях  дедуктивного мышления полагается, что люди действуют подобно интуитивным логикам и  применяют логические правила, пытаясь обосновать, что вывод доказательства следует из данных  посылок. Для иллюстрации рассмотрим следующее правило:  «Если есть высказывание вида «Если р, то q» и еще одно высказывание р, то можно вывести  высказывание q.»  По-видимому, взрослые знают это правило (возможно, бессознательно) и используют его для  принятия решения о том, что приведенное доказательство достоверно. В частности, они  идентифицируют первую посылку («Если идет дождь, я возьму зонтик») с частью «Если p, то q» этого  правила. Вторую посылку («Идет дождь») они идентифицируют с частью р этого правила, и затем  они выводят часть q («Я возьму зонтик»).  Следование правилам становится более осознанным, если усложнить доказательство.  Приведенное правило мы применяем дважды, когда оцениваем следующее доказательство:  2. а. Если идет дождь, я возьму зонтик.  б. Если я возьму зонтик, я его потеряю.  в. Идет дождь.  г. Следовательно, я потеряю свой зонтик.  Применяя знакомое нам правило к высказываниям а и в, можно сделать вывод, что «я возьму  зонтик»; а применяя это правило еще раз к высказыванию б и к выведенному высказыванию, можно  заключить, что «я потеряю свой зонтик». Одним из лучших подтверждений тому, что люди  используют подобные правила, является то, что количество правил, требуемых для доказательства,  определяет трудность последнего. Чем больше требуется правил, тем более вероятно, что человек  сделает ошибку, и тем больше времени у него уйдет на то, чтобы принять правильное решение (Rips,  1983, 1984).  Влияние содержания. Логические правила не охватывают всех аспектов дедуктивного  мышления. Эти правила определяются только логической формой высказываний, наша же  способность оценивать дедуктивное доказательство часто зависит также от содержания  высказываний. Этот момент иллюстрируется в следующем эксперименте. Испытуемым предъявляют  4 карточки. В одном варианте каждая карточка имеет на одной стороне букву, а на другой — цифру  (верхний ряд на рис. 9.7). Испытуемый должен решить, какие карточки следует перевернуть, чтобы  определить правильность утверждения «Если на одной стороне карты гласная, то на другой ее  стороне — четное число». Притом что большинство испытуемых правильно выбирали карточку с  буквой «Е», менее 10% из них выбирали также карточку с цифрой «7», что является вторым  правильным решением (чтобы убедиться в том, что карточка «7» — тоже правильное решение,  заметьте, что если на другой ее стороне гласная, утверждение опровергается).

psych.pdf,ru,17,"Предметная область психологии    Психологию можно определить как научное исследование поведения и психических  процессов. Этому определению соответствует огромное разнообразие тем. Чтобы дать о них  некоторое представление, кратко остановимся на пяти наиболее характерных проблемах, изучаемых  психологами. (Более подробно все эти проблемы будут рассмотрены в различных частях книги.)  Мозговые травмы и узнавание лиц. Неудивительно, что у людей с повреждениями мозга,  как правило, нарушается поведение. Удивительно, однако, то, что иногда, когда поврежден  ограниченный участок мозга, человек может потерять какую-то одну конкретную способность, а во  всем остальном выглядеть нормально. Впечатляющим примером такого случая являются люди,  которые в результате правостороннего повреждения определенного участка мозга не узнают  знакомых лиц, но практически нормально справляются со всеми остальными делами. Такая потеря  способности узнавать лица называется «прозопагнозией», и иногда она просто ошеломляет. Известен  случай, описанный неврологом Оливером Саксом, когда пациент на самом деле принял свою жену за  шляпу! (Sacks, 1985). В другом случае с прозопагнозией человек пожаловался официанту в ресторане,  что некто все время на него смотрит, на что ему сказали, что он сам смотрит в зеркало: этот человек  не смог узнать свое собственное лицо!  Такие случаи многое говорят нам о том, как работает нормальный мозг. Они показывают, что  некоторые психические функции — такие как узнавание лиц — локализованы в определенном  участке мозга. Это как если бы у нас в мозге был специальный механизм, который чаще всего делает  что-то одно, или если бы наш мозг, или разум, состоял из группы специалистов, каждый из которых  делает «свое дело» (подробнее об этом — в гл. 5).  Атрибуция личностных качеств. [Атрибуция — приписывание (чему-либо или кому-либо)  некоторого свойства. — Примеч. пер.] Представьте, что вы оказались свидетелем следующей сцены в  переполненном универмаге. Сборщик благотворительности подходит к покупательнице и на глазах у  всех умоляет ее сделать взнос; та решает для благотворительных целей подписать чек на 50 долларов.  Сочли бы вы ее щедрой? Или, наоборот, подумали бы, что эта женщина сделала пожертвование под  давлением? Нет никаких логических оснований предпочесть одно объяснение другому. В  бесчисленных экспериментах по изучению гипотетических ситуаций вроде вышеописанной показано,  что скорее всего эту женщину сочтут щедрой. Так что когда нам надо решить, отражает ли чей-то  поступок нечто особенное (например, пожертвование 50 долларов) в данной личности или же он  связан с особенностями ситуации, в которой этот человек находится, мы склонны (бессознательно)  приписывать данное поведение личности. Мы склонны считать, что поступки других людей вызваны  их внутренними качествами, а не ситуациями, в которых они оказываются. И эта склонность зачастую  приводит нас к ошибке. Иногда давление ситуации может быть настолько сильным, что почти  каждого заставляет действовать одинаково, но несмотря на это мы интерпретируем данное действие  как проявление индивидуальных особенностей личности. Ошибки, возникающие из-за этой  склонности, настолько распространены, что заставляют практически всех людей вести себя  предсказуемым образом (см. рис. 1.1).    ",3298,2125,,

psych.pdf,ru,288,"  Модели воспроизведения. Для объяснения влияния интерференции был разработан ряд  моделей воспроизведения. Как и в случае с кратковременной памятью, некоторые модели  воспроизведения из долговременной памяти основаны на процессе поиска, а некоторые — на  процессе активации.  Влияние интерференции, выявленное в эксперименте с банкиром и юристом, хорошо  согласуется с представлением, что воспроизведение из долговременной памяти — это процесс поиска  (см., напр.: Raaijmakers & Shiffrin, 1981). Для иллюстрации рассмотрим, как может распознаваться  предложение из предыдущего эксперимента: «банкир разбил бутылку» (рис. 8-8). Термин «банкир»  достигает своей репрезентации в памяти, локализуя тем самым поиск в соответствующей части  долговременной памяти. Начиная с этого момента, чтобы убедиться, что утверждение «разбил  бутылку» было одним из фактов, относящихся к банкиру, поиск должен вестись по трем путям.  Напротив, при проверке предложения «юрист выкрасил старый амбар» существуют только два пути  для поиска. Поскольку длительность поиска возрастает с количеством проверяемых путей, в случае  предложения с «банкиром» воспроизведение будет медленнее, чем в случае предложения с  «юристом». Вообще, воспроизведение труднее, когда с признаком воспроизведения связано больше  фактов, поскольку каждый факт добавляет еще один путь поиска.  Воспроизведение можно также представлять как процесс активации. Например, при попытке  распознать предложение «банкир разбил бутылку» испытуемый активирует репрезентацию «банкир»,  и затем активация распространяется по трем путям, исходящим от репрезентации «банкир» (рис. 8.8).  Когда определенная степень активации достигает предложения «разбил бутылку», оно может быть  распознано. Интерференция возникает из-за того, что активация, идущая от термина «банкир»,  должна разделиться на три пути. Значит, чем больше фактов ассоциировано с термином «банкир»,  тем слабее будет активация по каждому из путей и тем больше пройдет времени, пока достаточное  количество активации достигнет какого-либо определенного факта. Так что представление  воспроизведения в терминах активации также может объяснить, почему интерференция замедляет  воспроизведение (Anderson, 1983).    ",2219,1624,,
psych.pdf,ru,486,"1992 году, было обнаружено, что около 20% детей страдали ПТСР через год после катастрофы (La  Greca et al., 1996).  Травмы,  нанесенные  людьми,  такие  как  сексуальное  или  физическое  нападение,  террористическая акция или война, вызывают ПТСР с еще большей вероятностью, чем природные  катастрофы, по крайней мере по двум причинам. Во-первых, такие травмы порывают нашу веру в  положительность жизни и доброту людей, а когда эта вера подорвана, вероятность развития ПТСР  выше (Janoff-Bulman, 1992). Во-вторых, несчастья, причиненные людьми, чаще обрушиваются на  отдельных людей, чем на сообщества, а страдание в одиночку увеличивает риск развития ПТСР.  Исследование лиц, переживших холокост, показало, что почти половина из них все еще  страдала от ПТСР сорок лет спустя (Kuch & Сох, 1992). Среди бывших узников концлагерей диагноз  ПТСР встречался в три раза чаще, чем среди жертв, не прошедших через лагеря. Многие продолжают  переживать травмы, связанные с преследованием в своих сновидениях, и боятся, что в их отсутствие с  их супругами или детьми может случиться несчастье.  Исследование жертв изнасилования показывает, что около 95% посттравматических  стрессовых симптомов являются достаточно острыми для постановки диагноза расстройства в  течение первых двух недель после изнасилования (см. рис. 14.1). Около 50% жертв соответствуют  критериям диагноза ПТСР через три месяца после изнасилования, а до 25% жертв страдают от ПТСР  и спустя четыре-пять лет (Foa & Riggs, 1995; Resnick, Kilpatrick, Dansky & Sanders, 1993).

psych.pdf,ru,545,"  Рис. 15.9. ПЭТ-сканер показывает разницу в уровне метаболизма между участками мозга у  больного шизофренией и у нормального человека.    Во-вторых, люди, страдающие шизофренией, имеют расширенные пазухи (ventricles) —  заполненные жидкостью полости в мозге (Andreasen et al., 1990). Увеличение размеров пазух  свидетельствует об атрофии или поражениях других тканей мозга. Поражение специфических  отделов мозга вызывает увеличение пазух, приводящее к различным формам шизофрении (Breier et  al., 1992).  Хотя в нейрохимических теориях настроения основное внимание уделяется норэпинефрину и  серотонину, ответственным за развитие шизофрении считается допамин. Согласно ранним  допаминовым теориям шизофрении, считалось, что это расстройство является результатом  присутствия повышенного количества допамина в ключевых участках мозга. Сегодня данная точка  зрения рассматривается как слишком упрощенная. Согласно новейшим теориям, происходит сложное  нарушение баланса уровней допамина в различных участках мозга (Davis et al., 1991). Прежде всего  может  иметь  место  повышенная  допаминовая  активность  в  мезолимбической  системе,  субкортикальном отделе мозга, ответственном за когнитивную деятельность и эмоции, приводящая к  появлению «позитивных» симптомов шизофрении — галлюцинаций, иллюзий и беспорядочных  мыслей. С другой стороны, может иметь место чрезвычайно низкий уровень допаминовой активности  в префронтальной зоне мозга, ответственной за внимание, мотивацию и организацию поведения.  Низкая допаминовая активность в префронтальной зоне вызывает «негативные» симптомы  шизофрении — отсутствие мотивации, неспособность ухаживать за своим телом и неадекватные  эмоциональные реакции.  Данные о роли допамина получены из двух источников. Во-первых, антипсихотические  препараты, успешно снимающие симптомы шизофрении, снижают количество используемого  допамина в мозге. Исследователи полагают, что это достигается блокировкой допаминовых  рецепторов. Эти препараты не излечивают шизофрению, но уменьшают галлюцинации и бред,  улучшают концентрацию и делают многие симптомы шизофрении не такими странными. Кроме того,  было обнаружено, что терапевтическая сила препаратов этого ряда пропорциональна их способности  к блокировке допаминовых рецепторов (Creese, Burt & Shyder, 1978).  То, что аномалии допаминового метаболизма могут быть причиной шизофрении,  подтверждают также наблюдения за действием амфетаминов, которые усиливают высвобождение  допамина. У принимающих амфетамины в повышенных дозах проявляется психотическое поведение,  близко напоминающее шизофрению, и снимаются эти симптомы теми же антипсихотическими  средствами, которыми лечат шизофрению. Когда пациентам с шизофренией дают низкие дозы  амфетаминов, их симптомы значительно усугубляются. В этих случаях этот препарат не вызывает  психоза сам по себе, а усугубляет те симптомы, которые может переживать пациент (Snyder, 1980).  Например, один пациент поступил в больницу с утверждением, что из головы людей исходят духи и  говорят с ним. После лечения антипсихотическим препаратом он согласился, что его разговоры о  духах были «дурацкой болтовней», но через минуту после укола амфетаминов он снова утверждал,  что из головы интервьюера исходят духи (Janovsky et al., 1973).

psych.pdf,ru,144,"  Рис. 4.23. Чистый тон. Вибрирующий камертон создает последовательность волн сжатия и  расширения воздуха, подчиняющихся синусоидальному закону. Такой звук называется чистым тоном.  Он описывается параметрами частоты и интенсивности. Когда камертон делает 100 колебаний в  секунду, он создает звуковую волну со 100 сжатиями в секунду, или с частотой 100 герц.  Интенсивность (или амплитуда) чистого тона — это разница в давлении между пиками и  впадинами. Форму волны любого звука можно разложить на ряд синусоидальных волн с различной  частотой, амплитудой и фазой. Когда эти синусоидальные волны складываются, получается  первоначальная форма волны.    Второй параметр чистого тона — его интенсивность (амплитуда), т. е. различие давлений  между пиком и впадиной на графике зависимости давления от времени (см. рис. 4.23). Интенсивность  — основа восприятия громкости. Интенсивность звука обычно измеряется в децибелах (дБ); росту  интенсивности на 10 децибел соответствует увеличение мощности в 10 раз, росту на 20 децибел —  увеличение в 100 раз, 30 децибел — 1000 раз и так далее. Например, тихий шепот в беззвучной  обстановке библиотеки имеет интенсивность около 30 децибел, в шумном ресторане уровень звука  может равняться 70 децибелам, уровень звука на рок-концерте может достигать 120 децибел, а шум  взлетающего самолета может превышать 140 децибел. Постоянное воздействие уровня звука,  превышающего 100 децибел, может повлечь за собой необратимую потерю слуха.  И последней характеристикой звука является тембр — наше восприятие сложности звука.  Практически ни один из звуков, окружающих нас в повседневной жизни, не является столь простым,  как чистые тона, о которых мы говорили выше. (Исключение составляют лишь камертоны и  некоторые  электронные  музыкальные  инструменты.)  Звуки,  издаваемые  акустическими  инструментами, автомобилями, человеческим голосом, животными и водопадами, характеризуются  сложными паттернами звукового давления.  <Рис.

Как указано в ее подзаголовке, эта книга сосредоточена на практических методах достижения личных  и учебных успехов в колледже.      К читателю (от редакторов перевода)    Психический мир чрезвычайно разнообразен, изменчив, неправдоподобно сложен, в каком бы  масштабе его ни рассматривать — в масштабе отдельного индивида или в масштабе всей культурной  истории человечества. В любом случае он по сложности соизмерим или превосходит Вселенную.  Поэтому не может быть одного учебника на все времена, пусть даже он написан одним самым  гениальным автором. Многие превосходные учебники психологии прошлого сегодня стали  достоянием истории, что, впрочем, еще не основание, чтобы о них забыть и перестать к ним  обращаться. Не утратила своего значения, например, «Феноменология духа» Г. Ф. Гегеля, в  предисловии к первому изданию которой автор назвал ее учебником психологии. Полезно  обращаться к учебникам Г. И. Челпанова (1898), А. Бена (1902-1906), У. Джеймса (1905), В. Вундта  (1912), Э. Титченера (1914), Н. Н. Ланге (1914), Дж. Уотсона (1925), Р. Вудвортса (1950), С. Стивенса  (1960), П. Фресса и Ж. Пиаже (1966) и многим другим.  Каждый из названных полноценных учебников интересен не только, так сказать, своей  служебной функцией, но и тем, что в нем представлен очередной шаг на пути к целостному видению  психологии как науки. Поэтому новые учебники привлекают внимание не только студентов и  преподавателей, но и зрелых ученых, озабоченных перспективами развития своей науки.  В нашей стране заслуживают доброго слова учебники-ветераны, по которым учились и учатся  многие поколения психологов. До сих пор не утратили своей популярности «Основы общей  психологии» (1940) С. Л. Рубинштейна. Это единственный у нас учебник, заслуживающий  наименования университетского, конечно, в старом, не девальвированном смысле слова  «университет». Многочисленные попытки (и претензии) создать сколько-нибудь равноценный  университетский учебник за истекшие более чем 60 лет успехом не увенчались. Слишком высокая  планка была задана его автором. Это, разумеется, не украшает советскую (и российскую)  психологию, в том числе и прежде всего по пустякам соперничавших друг с другом ленинградскую и  московскую школы психологов. Нужно сказать спасибо трагически погибшему А. В. Брушлинскому,  усилиями которого в 1989 году появилось 3-е издание «Основ...».

Согласно такому взгляду, почти  любой психотерапевтический метод должен давать положительные результаты, если клиент верит в  его эффективность. Если это так, то для терапевта крайне важно передать клиенту убеждение в том,  что его метод лечения подействует.  Идея о центральной роли плацебо-эффекта в психотерапии беспокоит некоторых клиницистов.  Они чувствуют, что тем самым психотерапию связывают с шарлатанством и шаманством, а это  означает, что весь этот процесс является самообманом. Но это не так. Врачам и психотерапевтам уже  давно известно, что установки и убеждения пациента крайне важны для успешного лечения.  Эффективность любого лечения будет выше, если пациент в него верит и мотивирован на правильное  его употребление. Чем принижать важность плацебо-эффекта, лучше заняться дальнейшим  исследованием переменных, которые ему способствуют.  Кроме того, исследователи, желающие продемонстрировать эффективность того или иного  метода лечения, должны контролировать эффект плацебо. Это делается путем сложного  исследования, при котором создается контрольная группа плацебо, а также контрольная группа без  лечения. Например, эксперимент по испытанию эффективности систематической десенсибилизации  для снижения беспокойства при публичных выступлениях включал следующие группы:  систематической десенсибилизации; инсайт-терапии; повышенного внимания и плацебо и  контрольная группа без лечения. Испытуемые из группы внимания и плацебо встречались с  сочувствующим терапевтом, который заставлял их поверить, что принимаемые таблетки снизят у них  общую чувствительность к стрессу. Чтобы убедить их, он на протяжении нескольких занятий после  приема «транквилизатора» давал им прослушать «стрессовую запись» (якобы ту же, что применялась  при подготовке астронавтов к работе в условиях стресса). На самом же деле таблетки были плацебо, а  на ленте записаны невербальные звуки, которые в другом исследовании были сочтены не  стрессовыми, а наводящими скуку. Таким путем исследователь поднимал ожидания испытуемых в  том, что их связанное с выступлениями беспокойство снизится в результате приема таблеток.  Результаты этого исследования показали, что в группе систематической десенсибилизации  улучшение (снижение беспокойства, связанного с выступлением) было гораздо значительнее, чем в  группе без лечения, и больше, чем в группах внимания-плацебо и инсайт-терапии. Терапевтический  эффект в последних двух группах был довольно значительным (Paul, 1967). Включив в исследование  группу внимания-плацебо, экспериментатор смог сделать вывод, что успех систематической  десенсибилизации объясняется не только плацебо-реакцией.  Механизм плацебо-реакции неизвестен. Предлагались многочисленные гипотезы, но до сих  пор ни одна из них не получила существенного эмпирического подтверждения. Один ряд объяснений  основывается на социальном влиянии (см. главу 18). Поскольку пациенты считают, что врачи и  психотерапевты обладают социальной властью, они могут оказаться весьма внушаемы перед такими  влиятельными авторитетами, и их легко убедить в наступлении благотворного действия. Кроме того,  роль пациента предписывает ему соблюдать определенное поведение. Хороший пациент — это тот,  кому становится лучше; улучшение оправдывает первоначальную заботу терапевта и его  последующий интерес.  Другое объяснение обращено к ожиданиям индивида. Предписывающий лечение человек  намеренно или ненамеренно внушает ожидания относительно успеха лечения. Пациент также  поступает на лечение с определенными ожиданиями, основанными на его предыдущем опыте.  Ожидание улучшения и сильное желание, чтобы оно произошло, являются существенными  компонентами надежды. А надежда может оказывать сильное влияние на эмоции человека и  процессы в его организме. Некоторые исследователи полагают, что это влияние может  опосредоваться медиаторами группы эндорфинов. В главе 2 мы рассказывали о влиянии эндорфинов,  или «естественных опиатов мозга», на настроение и субъективное переживание боли. Может  оказаться, что они играют роль и в плацебо-реакции.  ---      Современные голоса в психологии  Действительно ли «Анонимные алкоголики» (АА) избавляют от злоупотребления  алкоголем?
